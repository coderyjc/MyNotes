### Conversation 1



**Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.**



1. A) They reward businesses that eliminate food waste.

B) They prohibit the sale of foods that have gone stale.

C) They facilitate the donation of unsold foods to the needy.

D) They forbid businesses to produce more foods than needed.



2. A) It imposed penalties on businesses that waste food.

B) It passed a law aiming to stop overproduction.

C) It voted against food import from outside Europe.

D) It prohibited the promotion of bulk food sales.



3. A) It has warned its people against possible food shortages.

B) It has penalized businesses that keep overproducing foods.

C) It has started a nationwide campaign against food waste.

D) It has banned supermarkets from dumping edible foods.



4. A) The confusion over food expiration labels.

B) The surplus resulting from overproduction.

C) Americans’ habit of buying food in bulk.

D) A lack of regulation on food consumption.





**M**:  And now, for the lighter side of the news, Europe is **setting an example for** the rest of the world when it comes to food waste.

**W:** That's right, John. This week, the Italian government passed legislation that aims to dramatically reduce the amount of food wasted in the country. New laws have been put into place that would make it easier for farms and supermarkets to donate unsold foods to those who are in need.【Q1】

**M:** Yes. And in addition to this, businesses will now be rewarded for successful efforts to cut food waste.

**W:** Italy is not the only country to focus on reducing food waste.Just earlier this year, the European Parliament voted in favor of **legislation** that would stop grocery giants from unfair trading practices that result in overproduction, thus creating waste.【Q2】

**M:** In France, the government has banned supermarkets from throwing away edible foods and imposed harsh penalties on businesses that fail to **comply with** the regulations.【Q3】

**W:** While there is still much progress to be made, other countries could learn a tiling or two from the example set by France and Italy. In the United Sates, up to 40% of all food goes uneaten,**despite** the fact that one in seven American households lacks regular access to good food. One major cause of this problem is the confusion over food expiration labels, which are currently not regulated by the government.【Q4】

**M:** All this could change soon. This wave of new laws in Europe will definitely put more pressure on lawmakers to reduce food waste here. We turn now to a spokesperson from Harvard University’s Food Law and Policy Clinic for more on the story. And now, let’s welcome Professor Edward Baker to speak to us.



男：现在报道一则轻松的新闻。在食品浪费问题上，欧洲正在为世界其他地区树立榜样。

女：没错，约翰。意大利政府本周通过了旨在大幅减少该国食品浪费的法规。新的法规已经开始实施，这将使农场和超市更容易向有需要的人捐赠未售出的食品。

男：是的。除此之外，成功减少食品浪费的企业将获得嘉奖。

女：意大利并不是唯一致力于减少食物浪费的国家。就在今年早些时候，欧洲议会投票通过了一项法案，该法案将阻止零售巨头实施的不公平贸易行为，这会导致生产过剩，从而造成浪费。

男：在法国，政府禁止超市扔掉可食用的食品，并对不遵守规定的商家处以严厉的处罚。

女：不过仍有许多地方有待改善。其他国家可以从法国和意大利树立的范例中学习一些方法。每七个美国家庭中就有一个家庭无法经常获得良好食物。尽管如此，美国多达40%的食品还是被浪费掉。造成这一问题的主要原因之一是人们对食品过期标签的混淆，目前政府在这方面还没有实行监管。

男：这一切很快就会改变。欧洲的这一波新法规必将给立法者施加更大的压力，以减少食品浪费。我们现在请哈佛大学食品法律与政策分析的发言人来进一步阐述这方面的事。现在让我们欢迎Edward Baker教授和我们谈谈。

### Passage 1

**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**



9. A) They are thin, tall, and unlike real human beings.

B) They have more than twenty different hair textures.

C) They have twenty-four different body shapes in total.

D) They represent people from virtually all walks of life.



10. A) They do not reflect young girls’ aspirations.

D) Their body shapes have not changed much.



11. A) In toy stores.

B) In shopping malls.

C) On the Internet.

D) At Barbie shops.



Barbie dolls have a particular look to them. They’re thin, tall, long-legged... and virtually unlike any real human being.【Q9】 Although over the years Barbie has had more than 180 different careers-including football coach, sign language teacher, ambassador, president and astronaut—her body shape hasn’t changed much. Last year Mattel, the company that makes Barbie dolls, added some Barbies to its line that have different skin tones and hair textures. There are now Barbies with one of seven skin tones, 22 eye colours and 24 hair styles to choose from. Last year Mattel also gave Barbie a flat foot, rather than forcing her to be “in heels” all the time like the original Barbie is. Now they are introducing new Barbies with three slightly different body shapes, while the original, tall and thin Barbies will continue to be sold. In a statement on its website, the company says it wants Barbies to look more like real people, and to give “girls everywhere...infinitely more ways to spark their imagination and play out their stories.” Although many people say the new Barbies are a step in the right direction, some people say they don't go far enough. They say that the new body shapes could be even more different from the original, tall, thin Barbies.【Q10】 Sales of Barbie dolls have been falling “every year since 2012”, according to CBC News. The toys aren’t in stores yet but they will be sold online at the Barbie website, starting this week, for $9.99.【Q11】



芭比娃娃都有着特别的外貌。她们又瘦又高，腿也很长，实际上不像真人。多年来，尽管芭比娃娃已经有180多种不同类型的职业，包括足球教练、手语教师、大使、总统和宇航员，但她的体形并没有发生太大变化。去年，制作芭比娃娃的美泰公司在生产线中增加了一些有着不同肤色和发质的芭比娃娃。现在有七种肤色、二十二种眼睛的颜色和二十四种发型的芭比娃娃可供选择。去年，美泰公司还给芭比娃娃设计了平足，而不是强迫她像最初的芭比娃娃那样一直穿着高跟鞋。现在，他们正在推出三种体形略有不同的新款芭比娃娃。同时原来又高又瘦的芭比娃娃将继续出售。在公司网站上的一则声明中，该公司表示想让芭比娃娃看起来更像真人，并且赋予世界各地的女孩们激发想象力的无限方法，讲出她们自己的故事。很多人说新款芭比娃娃是朝正确方向迈出的一步，但是有些人说他们的改变还远远不够。他们说新款芭比娃娃的体形可以与原来又瘦又高的芭比娃娃区别更大些。根据CBC的新闻报道，自2012年以来芭比娃娃的销售量每年都在下降。这些玩具还没有在商场内上架，但从本周开始，芭比娃娃将以9美元99美分的价格在网上销售。



**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

### Passage 2



**Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.**



12. A) Moveable metal type began to be used in printing,

B) Chinese printing technology was first introduced.

C) The earliest known book was published.

D) Metal type was imported from Korea.



13. A) It had more than a hundred printing presses.

B) It was the biggest printer in the 16th century.

C) It helped the German people become literate.

D) It produced some 20 million volumes in total.



14. A) It pushed handwritten books out of circulation.

B) It boosted the circulation of popular works.

C) It made writing a very profitable career.

D) It provided readers with more choices.



15. A) It accelerated the extinction of the Latin language.

B) It standardized the publication of grammar books.

C) It turned translation into a welcome profession.

D) It promoted the growth of national languages.





The earliest printed book we know today appeared in China in the year 868, and metal type was in use in Korea at the beginning of the fifteenth century, but it was in Germany around the year 1450 that a printing press using moveable metal type was invented.【Q12】Capitalism turned printing from an invention into an industry. Right from the start, book printing and publishing were organized on capitalist lines. The biggest sixteen-century printer, Plantin of Antwerp, had 24 printing presses and employed more than a hundred workers.【Q13】Only a small fraction of the population was literate, but the production of books grew at an extraordinary speed. By 1500 some 20 million volumes had already been printed. The immediate effect of printing was to increase the circulation of works that were already popular in a handwritten form,【Q14】while less popular works went out of circulation. Publishers were interested only in books that would sell fairly quickly in sufficient numbers to cover the costs of production and make a profit. Thus, while printing enormously increased access to books by making cheap, high-volume production possible, it also reduced choice. The great cultural impact of printing was that it facilitated the growth of national languages.【Q15】Most early books were printed in Latin, but the market for Latin was limited, and in its pursuit of larger markets the book trade soon produced translations into the national languages emerging at the time. Printing indeed played a key role in standardizing and stabilizing these languages by fixing them in print, and producing dictionaries and grammar books.



如今我们了解到最早的印刷书籍于868年出现在中国。在15世纪初的韩国，金属活字得到使用。但是在1450年左右，德国发明了一种可使用金属活字的印刷机。资本主义将印刷术从发明转化为工业。从一开始，资本家们就在生产线上组织并筹划书籍的印刷和出版。16世纪最大的安特卫普的帕拉丁印刷厂有24台印刷机，雇用了一百多名工人。有读写能力的人很少，但是书籍的印刷数量却以惊人的速度增长着。到1500年时已印制了约两千万册的书籍。印刷业发展的效果即刻显现，一些流行的手写作品的发行量得到增加，而不受欢迎的作品则不再流通。出版商只对畅销书感兴趣，这样就可以支付生产成本并实现盈利。因此，印刷业的发展使人们可以用很低的成本大量印制书籍，这极大地促进了书籍的使用，但是这也减少了人们对书籍的选择。印刷业的巨大文化影响是，它促进了国家语言的发展。早期的多数书籍都是用拉丁语印制的，但是拉丁语的市场很有限。为了寻求更大的市场，图书行业很快将拉丁语翻译成当时出现的国家语言。通过印制、出版字典和语法书，印刷业在规范和稳固语言方面的确起到了重要作用。



**Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

12. What happened in Germany around the year 1450?

13. What does the speaker say about the printer Plantin of Antwerp?

14. What was the immediate effect of printing?

15. What was the great cultural impact of printing?



12.大约在1450年德国发生了什么事？

A) 金属活字开始在印刷业中得到使用。B)首先引进了中国的印刷技术。

C) 出版早期广为人知的书籍。D)从韩国进口了金属活字。



13.关于安特卫普的帕拉丁印刷厂，讲话者都说了些什么？

A)它有一百多台印刷机。B)它是16世纪最大的印刷厂。

C)它帮助德国人民提高读写能力。D)它共印制了约两千万册书。



14.印刷业的直接效果是什么？

A)它导致手写书籍无法流通。B)它促进了通俗作品的流通。

C)它使写作成为一种非常有利可图的职业。D)它为读者提供了更多的选择。



15.印刷业对文化产生了哪些巨大的影响？

A)它加速了拉丁语的消失。B)它规范了语法书的出版。

### Recording 1



**Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard**

16. A) They get bored after working for a period of time.

B) They spend an average of one year finding a job.

C) They become stuck in the same job for decades.

D) They choose a job without thinking it through.



17. A) See if there will be chances for promotion.

D) Decide which job is most attractive to you.



18. A) The qualifications you have.

B) The pay you are going to get.

D) The work environment you will be in.



You dream about being a movie star. You’ll live in a big house in Hollywood, go to the Oscars every year—and win! You’ll be rich and famous. Wait a minute, you also hate having your photo taken, and you’re very shy, so how could you ever become a movie star? Choosing the right career can be hard. Many people graduate from school or college not knowing what to do with their lives, and get a job without really thinking about it.【Q16】For some, things work out fine, but others often find themselves stuck in a job they hate. Your working life lasts an average of forty years, so it’s important to find a job you like and feel enthusiastic about. Luckily, there are many ways you can get help to do this. The Australian website, www.careersonline.com, compares choosing a career with going to the movies. Before you see a movie, you find out what films are showing. The site suggests you should do the same with your career—find out what jobs are available and what your options are.【Q17】 Next, decide which movie you like best. If you’re not a romantic person, you won’t want to see a love story. In other words, with your career, you should decide which job will suit your personality. Finally, decide how to get movie tickets, and find out where the theater is before you go. With your career, you need to find information about where you can work, and how to get a job in that profession. So how do you start? Begin by asking yourself some questions. Some jobs require you to have certain life experiences【Q18】: Have you traveled overseas? Do you have any extra certificates besides your degree, such as a first aid license for example? Your physical state and build can also affect which jobs you can do. A person, for example, who is allergic to cats, would probably never become an animal doctor. Flight attendants, firefighters and police officers have to be over a certain height and be physically fit. Your personality matters, too. Are you outgoing or shy? If you like working alone, a job that requires lots of teamwork might not suit you. Choosing a career can take time and a lot of thought. However, when you know you can look forward to working in your dream job, you’ll be glad you thought it through.



你梦想成为电影明星，住在好莱坞的一所大房子里，每年去参加奥斯卡颁奖典礼并且还赢得奖项。你会变得富有而有名气。等一下，你非常害羞，也讨厌拍照。那么你怎么可能成为电影明星呢？选择合适的职业可能很难。许多人从学校或大学毕业后，不知道如何应对自己的生活，选择工作时也不细加考虑。对于一些人来说，事情进展得很顺利，但另外一些人常常发现自己被困在讨厌的工作中。你的工作生涯平均持续40年，所以找到一份自己喜欢的、对之充满热情的工作很重要。幸运的是，有很多方法可以帮助你做到这一点。一家澳洲网站（www.careersonline.com）以去看电影来比喻职业选择。在看电影之前，首先须考虑有哪些电影在上映。该网站建议你在找工作时也应该这样做。先找出有哪些工作可供选择，你的选择是什么？接下来决定你最喜欢哪部电影。如果你不是一个浪漫的人，你不会想看爱情文艺片。换句话说，在你的职业生涯中，你应该决定哪种工作适合你的性格。最后决定如何买到电影票，去看之前还要找到电影院的位置。你需要找到工作地方的信息以及如何在那个行业找到工作。怎样开始呢？首先问自己一些问题。有些工作要求你有一定的生活经验。你出国旅行过吗？除了学位以外，你还有其他证书吗？例如，急救许可证。你的身体状况和体形也会影响你的工作选择。例如，一个对猫过敏的人可能永远不会成为一名动物医生。航空乘务员、消防队员和警察的身高必须超过一定高度，并且要身体健康。你的性格也很重要，是外向开朗还是内向害羞？如果你喜欢独自工作，经常需要团队合作的工作可能不适合你。选择一个职业需要时间和深思熟虑。然而，当你知道自己可以期待得到梦想的工作时，你会很高兴曾经深思熟虑过。

Kwanzaa is a cultural festival during which African-Americans celebrate and reflect upon their rich heritage as the products of two worlds.【Q19】It begins December 26th and lasts for seven days. Kwanzaa was founded in 1966 by Dr. Karenga, a college professor and African-American leader, who believed that a special holiday could help African-Americans meet their goals of building strong families, learning about their history and creating a sense of unity.【Q20】After conducting extensive research in which he studied the festivals of many African groups of people, he decided that the new holiday should be a harvest or “first fruits” celebration, incorporating ideas from many different harvest traditions. Kwanzaa is a Kiswahili word meaning “the first fruits of the harvest.”【Q21】The East African language of Kiswahili was chosen as an official language of Kwanzaa because it is a non-tribal language spoken by a large portion of the African population. Also, its pronunciation is easy. Kwanzaa is based on seven principles which are unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. One principle is highlighted each day of the holiday. In preparation for the celebration, a straw mat is placed on the table, along with a candle holder with seven candles, one black, three red, and three green. The black candle represents the African-American people, the red is for their struggles, and the green represents their hopes for the future. Other items placed on the table are a variety of fruit, ears of corns, gifts and a communal unity cup for pouring and sharing drinks. Each day of Kwanzaa, usually before the evening meal, family and friends gather around the table and someone lights the candle, beginning with the black. After that, candles are lit alternately from left to right. While the candle is being lit, a principle is recited; then each person present takes a turn to speak about the importance that principle has to himself or herself.【Q22】Next, the ceremony focuses on remembering those who have died. A selected person pours water or juice from the unity cup into a bowl. That person then drinks from the cup and raises it high saying “Harambee” which means “Let’s all pull together.” All repeat “Harambee” seven times and each person drinks from the cup. Then names of African-American leaders and heroes are called out, and everyone reflects upon the great things these people did. The ceremony is followed by a meal, and then singing and perhaps listening to African music.





宽扎节是非裔美国人庆祝的文化节。节日期间，他们思考来自两个世界的丰富文化遗产。宽扎节从12月26日开始，持续七天。该节日于1966年由担任大学教授，同时还是非洲裔美国领导人的Karanga博士创立。他认为，一个特殊的节日可以帮助非裔美国人实现他们建立强大家庭、了解自己的历史和培养团结精神的目标。Karanga博士研究了许多非洲群体的节日。在进行广泛的研究之后，他决定新的节日应该是庆祝丰收或第一次的收获，这个节日融合了许多不同庆祝收获的传统思想。宽扎节是斯瓦希里语，意思是第一次收获的果实。东非的斯瓦希里语被选定作为宽扎节的官方语言，因为它是一种非部落语言，非洲人口中很大一部分人使用这种语言，而且该语言的发音也很简单。宽扎节以七项原则为基础，这些原则包括团结、自立、共同工作及责任、经济合作、目标、创造和信仰。节日的每一天都要强调一项原则。在为庆典做准备时，将一张草席放在桌子上，席上还有一个插着七支蜡烛的烛台：有一支蜡烛的颜色是黑色，还有三支红色和三支绿色。黑色蜡烛代表的是非裔美国人，红色代表他们的奋斗精神，绿色代表他们对未来的希望。桌子上还摆放着其他物品，有各种各样的水果、玉米皮、礼物和用于倾倒、分享饮品的圣餐联合杯。宽扎节的每一天，通常在晚餐之前，家人和朋友们围坐在桌旁，有人首先点亮一支黑色蜡烛。之后将蜡烛从左到右依次点亮。点燃一支蜡烛时人们便背诵一个原则。然后在场的每个人轮流讲述这些原则对自己的重要性。接下来，庆祝仪式着重于纪念那些逝去的人。挑选出来的人将联合杯中的水或果汁倒入碗里。然后这个人干杯并将杯子高高举起说：哈兰比意思是让我们齐心协力。所有人重复说哈兰比七次后干杯。然后大家呼唤非洲裔领袖和英雄的名字，每个人都在思考这些人的伟大成就。庆祝仪式之后是聚餐，然后唱歌，或者是听听非洲音乐。

The Mediterranean diet is based upon the eating patterns of traditional cultures in the Mediterranean region. Several noted nutritionists and research projects have concluded that this diet is one of the most healthful in the world in terms of preventing such illnesses as heart disease and cancer, and increasing life expectancy.【Q23】The countries that have inspired the Mediterranean diet all surround the Mediterranean Sea. These cultures have eating habits that developed over thousands of years. In Europe, parts of Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, and southern France adhere to principles of the Mediterranean diet, as do Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa. Parts of the Balkan region and Turkey follow the diet, as well as Middle Eastern countries like Lebanon and Syria.

The Mediterranean region is warm and sunny and produces large supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables almost year-round that people eat many times a day. Wine, bread, olive oil and nuts are other staples of the region, and the Mediterranean Sea has historically yielded abundant quantities of fish. International interest in the therapeutic qualities of the Mediterranean diet began back in the late 1950s, when medical researchers started to link the occurrence of heart disease with diet. Dr. Ancel Keys performed an epidemiological analysis of diets around the world.Entitled the Seven Countries Study, it is considered one of the greatest studies of its kind ever performed. 【Q24】 In it, Keys gathered data on heart disease and its potential causes from nearly 13,000 men in Greece, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Japan, Finland, the Netherlands, an the United States. The study was conducted over a period of decades. It concluded that the Mediterranean people in the study enjoyed some significant health advantages.

The Mediterranean groups had lower mortality rates in all age brackets and from all causes, particularly from heart disease.【Q25】 The study also showed that the Mediterranean diet is as high or higher in fat than other diets, obtaining up to 40% of all its calories from fat. It has, however, different patterns of fat intake. Mediterranean cooking uses smaller amounts of saturated fat and higher amounts of unsaturated fat, mostly in the form of olive oil. Saturated fate are fats that are found principally in meat and dairy products, although some nuts and vegetable oils also contain them. Saturated fats are used by the body to make cholesterol, and high levels of cholesterol have since been directly related to heart disease.



地中海居民的日常饮食是以该地区的传统饮食文化模式为基础。在预防心脏病、癌症等疾病，提高预期寿命方面，数位知名营养学家从研究中得出结论，地中海地区的饮食方法是世界上最健康的饮食方法之一。那些鼓励采用地中海地区饮食方式的国家也位于地中海附近。这些文化包含了几千年来养成的饮食习惯。如同北非的摩洛哥和突尼斯，在欧洲的部分地区，意大利、希腊、葡萄牙、西班牙和法国南部仍坚持地中海地区的饮食方式。巴尔干半岛和土耳其的部分地区以及黎巴嫩和叙利亚等中东国家也遵循这种饮食习惯。

地中海地区气候温暖、阳光充足，几乎全年都有大量的新鲜水果和蔬菜供应，人们每天会食用很多次。葡萄酒、面包、橄榄油和坚果是该地区的其他主食，历史上的地中海还盛产鱼类。国际上对地中海地区饮食疗法的兴趣始于20世纪50年代末，当时的医学研究人员开始将心脏病的发生与饮食联系起来。Ansokees医生在世界范围内开展了一项名为七国研究的饮食流行病学分析。人们认为这是有史以来最伟大的研究之一。该项研究中，Keys收集了心脏病及其潜在病因的数据，这些数据来自希腊、意大利、克罗地亚、塞尔维亚、日本、芬兰、荷兰和美国的近13000名男子。这项研究持续了几十年。它的结论是，研究中的地中海人有着显著的健康优势。

在地中海地区的实验分组里，各个年龄段的人们因各种病因，特别是心脏病导致的死亡率低于其他地区的试验分组。这项研究还表明，与其他地区的日常饮食相比，地中海地区的饮食中脂肪的含量同样高或更高，从脂肪中获取的热量高达40%。然而，它有不同的脂肪摄取模式。地中海人在烹饪时使用较少的饱和脂肪和更多的不饱和脂肪，比如他们经常用到橄榄油。尽管一些坚果和植物油也含有饱和脂肪或脂肪，但它们主要存在于肉类和乳制品中。饱和脂肪被用于制造胆固醇，胆固醇含量高与心脏病直接相关。
