M: Excuse me. Where’s your rock music section?

W: Rock music? I’m sorry, we’re a Jazz store. We don’t have any rock and roll.

M: Oh, you only have Jazz music, nothing else.

W: That’s right. (1)We’re the only record store in London dedicated exclusively to Jazz. Actually, we’re more than just a record store. We have a cafe and library upstairs and a ticket office down the hall where you can buy tickets to all the major Jazz concerts in the city. Also we have our own studio next door where reproduce albums for up and coming artists. We are committed to fostering new music talent. M: That’s so cool. (2)I guess there’s not much of a Jazz scene anymore. Not like they used to be. But here you’re trying to promote this great music genre.

W: Yes. Indeed, nowadays most people like to listen to pop and rock music. Hip hop music from America is also getting more and more popular. So as a result, there are fewer listeners of Jazz, which is a great shame because it’s an incredibly rich genre. But that’s not to say there isn’t any good new Jazz music being made out there anymore. Far from it. It’s just a much smaller market today.

M: So how would you define Jazz?

W: Interestingly enough, there’s no agreed upon definition of Jazz. (3)Indeed, there are many different styles of Jazz, some have singing, but most don’t. Some are electric and some aren’t. Some contain live experimentation, but not always. (3)While there’s no simple definition for it, And while there are many different styles of Jazz. You simply know it when you hear it. Honestly. (4)The only way to know what Jazz is, listen to it yourself. As the great trumpet player. Louis Armstrong said, if you’ve got to ask, you’ll never know.

男．打扰一下。你们的摇滚乐专区在哪里？

女：摇滚乐？对不起，我们是一家爵士乐店。我们没有摇滚乐的东西。

男：哦，你们只有爵士乐？没有其他的？

女：没错。我们是伦敦唯一一家专营爵士乐的唱片店。事实上，我们不仅仅是一家唱片店。楼上还有一家咖啡馆和一个图书馆，大厅尽头有一个售票处，在那里你可以买到城里所有大型爵士音乐会的票。隔壁也有我们自己的录音室，可以为未来的艺人录制专辑。我们致力于培养新的音乐人才。

男：太酷了！我想现在已经没有多少爵士乐的现场（演出）可以看了。至少不像以前那样了。但在这儿你们仍在试图推广这种伟大的音乐流派。

女：是的。的确，现在大多数人喜欢听流行音乐和摇滚乐。来自美国的嘻哈音乐也越来越受欢迎。结

果，听爵士乐的人就少了，这太可惜了，因为爵士乐是一种非常丰富的音乐类型。但这并不是说现在已经没有新的优秀爵士乐了。事实并非如此。只不过当今的市场小了很多。

男：那你怎么定义爵士乐呢？

女：有趣的是，人们对爵士乐的定义并没有一致的看法。的确，爵士乐有许多不同的风格，有些有歌

词，但大多数没有。有些是电子风格的，有些是艺术性的，有些还包含现场即兴，但并不总是这样。虽然爵士乐没有简单的定义，风格也各有不同。但当你听到的时候你就是能听出来。要知道爵士乐是什么，唯一的方法就是自己去听。伟大的小号演奏家的路易斯·阿姆斯特朗曾说过，“如果你一定要问，那你永远不会知道。”

### Conversation 2

Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.





5. A) She paid her mortgage.

B) She called on the man.

C) She made a business plan.

D) She went to the bank.



6. A) Her previous debt hadn’t been cleared yet.

B) Her credit history was considered poor.

C) She had apparently asked for too much.

D) She didn’t pay her mortgage in time.



7. A) Pay a debt long overdue.

C) Start her own business.

D) Check her credit history.



8. A) Seek advice from an expert about fundraising.

B) Ask for smaller loans from different lenders.

C) Build up her own finances step by step.

D) Revise her business proposal carefully.





M: (5)How did it go at the bank this morning?

W: Not well. My proposal was rejected.

M: Really? But why?

W: Bunch of reasons. For starters,(6) they said my credit history was not good enough.

M: Did they say how you could improve that?

W: Yes, they said that after five more years of paying my mortgage, then I will become a more viable candidate for a business loan. But right now it’s too risky for them to lend me money. They fear I will default on any business loan I’m given.

M: That doesn’t sound fair. (7)Your business idea is amazing. Did you show them your business plan? What did they say?

W: They didn’t really articulate any position regarding the actual business plan. They simply looked at my credit history and determined it was not good enough. They said the bank has strict guidelines and requirements as to who they can lend money to. And I simply don’t meet their financial threshold.

M: (8)What if you ask for a smaller amount? Maybe you could gather capital from other sources, smaller loans from more lenders.

W: You don’t get it. It doesn’t matter the size of the loan I ask for or the type of business I propose. That’s all inconsequential. The first thing every bank will do is study how much money I have and how much debt I have before they decide whether or not to lend me any more money. If I want to continue ahead with this dream of owning my own business, I have no other choice but to build up my own finances, I need around 20% more in personal savings and 50% less debt. That’s all there is to it.

M: I see now. Well,  it’s a huge pity that they rejected your request, but don’t lose hope. I still think that your idea is great and that you would turn it into a phenomenal success.

5. What did the woman do this morning?

6. Why was the woman’s proposal rejected?

7. What is the woman planning to do?

8. What does the man suggest the woman do?





男：今天早上去银行事儿办得怎么样？

女：不太好。我的申请被拒绝了。

男：真的吗？但是为什么呢？

女：有很多原因。首先，他们说我的信用记录不够好。

男：他们有说你能如何改进吗？

女：说了，他们说在我还了5年的按揭贷款后，我将更有可能申请商业贷款。但是现在他们借钱给我风险太大了。他们担心我会拖欠提供给我的每一笔商业贷款。

男：听起来不太公平啊。你的经营理念那么棒。你给他们看你的商业计划了吗？他们怎么说？

女：对于实际的商业计划，他们并没有阐明任何立场。他们只是看了看我的信用记录，认定我的信用记录不够好。他们表示，对于向谁放贷，银行有严格的指令和要求。而我就是没达到他们的经济要求。

男：如果你要求少贷一点呢？也许你可以从其他渠道筹集资金，从更多的贷方那里获得小额贷款。

女：你没明白。算了，没关系。我要求的贷款规模，或我提议的业务类型都是无关紧要的。每家银行

要做的第一件事就是评估我有多少钱，有多少债务，然后再决定是否再贷款给我。如果我想继续实现我自己事业的梦想，那么我别无选择，只能改善我的财务状况。我需要增加20％的个人储蓄，减少50％的债务。就是这样。

男：现在我明白了，他们拒绝了你的请求真是太遗憾了，但是你不要失去希望。我仍然认为你的想法很棒，你会把它变成非凡的成功。

There’s a lot about Leo Sanchez and his farm in Salinas, California. (9)That seems unusual. The national average farm size is around 440 acres, but his is only one acre.

The average age of farmers hovers around 58 years old, but he is just 26. And Sanchez constantly attempts to improve everything from seeding techniques out in the field to the promotion and sale of his produce online. This is evidence of an experimental approach. It’s an approach not dictated by the confines of conventional large scale agriculture lead by international corporations. (10)While farming is often difficult for both the body and mind, Sanchez says he and many of his fellow young farmers are motivated by desire to set a new standard for agriculture.

Many of them are employing a multitude of technologies, some new and some not so new. (11)Recently, Sanchez bought a hand operated tool which pulls out weeds and loosens soil. It actually dates back to at least 1701. It stands in sharp contrast to Sanchez, this other gadget: a gas-powered flame we killer, invented in 1997. He simply doesn’t discriminate when it comes to the newness of tools. If it works, it works. Farmers have a long history of invention and is no different today. Young farmers are guided by their love for agriculture and aided by their knowledge of technology to find inexpensive and appropriately sized tools. They collaborate and innovate. Sometimes the old stuff just works better or more efficiently.



9. What do we learn about Leo Sanchez’s farm?

10. What has motivated Leo Sanchez and his fellow young farmers to engage in farming?

11. Why did Leo Sanchez buy a hand operated weeding tool?





关于里奥·桑切斯和他在加州萨利纳斯的农场的许多故事都不太寻常。全国平均农场面积约440英亩，但他的只有一英亩。农民的平均年龄在58岁左右，而他只有26岁。桑切斯不断尝试改进每一个方面，从田间播种技术到在线推广并销售他的产品。这都可以表明他在尝试实验性的方法。这种方法不受国际公司主导的传统大规模农业的限制。

尽管农耕对身心来说都是个难题，但桑切斯说，他和他许多年轻农民伙伴们的出发点是要为农业设立一个新的标准。他们中的许多人使用着多种技术，有些是新技术，有些不是。最近，桑切斯买了一个手动除草松土的工具。它至少可以追溯到1701年。这与桑切斯于1997年发明的另一种由气体驱动的火焰小工具形成了鲜明的对比。当谈到工具的新奇之处时，他根本不会区别对待。如果成功了，就成功了。农民有着悠久的发明历史，如今也不例外。年轻的农民被他们对农业的热爱所引导，并受助于它们的技术知识。他们一起合作，改革创新，以找到既便宜又大小合适的工具。有时候旧工具反而更好用或更高效。



9．关于里奥·桑切斯的农场，我们了解到了什么？

A）可盈利且环保。

B）位置好，完全自动化。

C)小而突破传统。

D)肥沃且产量高。

C

D) It saves huge amounts of labour.







(12)Eat Grub is Britain’s first new food company that breaks western food boundaries by introducing edible insects as a new source of food.

And Samsbury's is the first UK supermarket to stock the company’s crunchy roasted crickets. Samsbury's insist that such food is no joke and could be a new, sustainable source of protein. Out of curiosity, I paid a visit to Samsbury's  as I put my hand into a packet of crickets with their tiny eyes and legs. The idea of one going in my mouth made me feel a little sick. (13)But the first bite was a pleasant surprise, a little dry and lacking of taste, but at least a wing didn’t get stuck in my throat.The roasted seasoning largely overpowered any other flavour, although there was slightly bitter after taste. The texture was crunchy, but smelt a little of cat food. Eat Grub also recommends the crickets as a topping for noodles, soups and salads.(14) The company boasts that its dried crickets contain more protein than beef, chicken, and pork, as well as minerals like iron and calcium. Unlike the production of meat, bugs do not use up large amounts of land, water or feed. (15)And insect farming also produces far fewer greenhouse gases.

However, despite 2 billion people worldwide already supplementing their diet with insects, consumer disgust remains a large barrier in many western countries. I’m not sure bugs will become a popular snack anytime soon, but they’re definitely food for fort.



12. What do we learn from the passage about the food company Eat Grub?

13. What does the speaker say about his first bite a roasted crickets?

14. What does Eat Grub say about his dried crickets?

15. What does the passage say about insect farming?









Eat Grub是英国第一家通过引入可食用昆虫作为新食物来源而打破西方食品边界的新食品公司。Sainsbury's是英国第一家供应脆烤蟋蟀的超市。

Samsbury's超市坚信这种食物不是笑话，而可能是一种新的可持续蛋白质来源。出于好奇，我去逛了逛Samsbury's超市，我把手伸进了一袋有着小眼睛和小腿儿的蟋蟀里。一想到有一个蟋蟀会进到我嘴里，我就觉得有点恶心。但第一口吃起来让我惊喜。有点干，没有味道，但至少没有翅膀卡在我的喉咙里。烤过的调味料在很大程度上盖过了其他味道，虽然后味有点苦。口感酥脆，但闻起来有点像猫粮。Eat Grub公司还推荐将蟋蟀作为面条、汤和沙拉的配料。

该公司声称，蟋蟀干比牛肉、鸡肉和猪肉含有更多的蛋白质，以及铁和钙等矿物质。与肉类生产不同，昆虫不会消耗大量的土地、水或饲料，此外，昆虫养殖产生的温室气体也少得多。然而，尽管全世界已经有20亿人用昆虫来补充他们的饮食，“消费者的厌恶"在许多西方国家仍然是一个巨大的障碍。我不确定虫子是否会很快成为流行的零食，但这一定值得我们思考。



12．从这篇文章中我们可以了解到关于食品公司Eat Grub的什么信息？

A）它把某种昆虫变成了一种新的食物来源。

B）它已经开始扩展英国以外的业务。

C）它从国外进口了一些外来食品。

D)它与Samsbury's联手出售宠物昆虫。

### Recording 1

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16. A)To categorize different types of learners.

B) To find out what students prefer to learn.

C) To understand the mechanism of the human brain.

D) To see if they are inherent traits affecting learning.



17. A) It was defective.

B) It was misguided.

C) It was original in design.

D) It was thought-provoking.



18. A) Auditory aids are as important as visual aids.

B) Visual aids are helpful to all types of learners.

C) Reading plain texts is more effective than viewing pictures.

D) Scientific concepts are hard to understand without visual aids.







Have you ever had someone try to explain something to you a dozen times with no luck? But then when you see a picture, the idea finally clicks. If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider yourself a visual learner. Or if reading or listening does the trick, maybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles. But is there really a way to categorize different types of students? Well it actually seems that multiple presentation formats, especially if one of them is visual. Help most people learn. When psychologists and educators test for learning styles, (16)they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that affect how well students learn instead of just a preference.

Usually they start by giving a survey to figure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then they try to teach the students something with a specific presentation style, like using visual AIDS, and do a follow up test to see how much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified verbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for example. (17)But according to a 2008 review, only one study that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their preferred style.

But the study had some big flaws. The researchers excluded 2/3 of the original participants, because they didn’t seem to have any clear learning style from the survey at the beginning. And they didn’t even report the actual test scores in the final paper. So it doesn’t really seem like learning styles are an inherited trait that we all have. But that doesn’t mean that all students will do amazingly, if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook. Instead, most people seem to learn better if they’re taught in several ways, especially if one is visual.

(18)In one study, researchers tested whether students remembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them or both. Everyone seemed to do better. If they got to see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners, their preference didn’t seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned basic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures to and everyone do better with the help of pictures.

16. Why do psychologists and educators study learning styles?

17. What does the speaker say about one study mentioned in the 2008 review?

18. What message does the speaker want to convey about learning at the end of the talk?





你是否曾有过这样的经历：有人试着向你解释一件事十几次都没有成功，但当你看到一张图片时，就豁然开朗了？如果这听起来很耳熟，你也许会认为自己是视觉型学习者。或者，如果阅读或听力奏效的话也许你会觉得自己是个语言型学习者。我们把这些称之为学习风格。但是真的有办法把不同类型的学生分类吗？实际上，多种呈现方式似乎都可以帮助大多数人学习，尤其当其中一种是视觉型时。

当心理学家和教育学家测试学习风格时，他们试图弄清楚这些风格是否是影响学生学习效果的固有特征，而不仅仅是一种喜好。通常他们会先做一个调查，找出学生喜欢的学习方式，比如视觉型学习或语言型学习。然后他们试着用一种特定的呈现方式教学生一些东西，比如使用视觉辅助，然后做一个后续测试，看看他们学到了多少。通过这种方式，研究人员可以观察到，当只是大声告知信息时，自我定义为语言型的学习者是否真的学得更好。

但是2008年的一项研究显示，仅有一项遵循这种设计的研究发现，学生用他们喜欢的风格实际上才学得最好。但这项研究存在一些重大缺陷。研究人员排除了2/3的原始参与者，因为他们在一开始的调查中似乎没有任何明确的学习风格，他们甚至没有在最后的报告中告知真实的测试分数。所以学习风格并不是我们都有的固有特质。但这并不意味着所有的学生都会取得惊人的成绩，如果他们只是把所有的时间都花在阅读课本上。相反，如果用好几种方式教学，大多数人似乎会学得更好，特别是当其中一种是视觉形方式时。在一项研究中，研究人员测试了学生在听到、看到或同时听到和看到单词时，是否能更好地记住这些单词。如果他们能看到印出来的字的话，每个人似乎能做得更好，即使是自我认定为听觉型的学习者，他们的偏好似乎也不影响什么。类似的研究还测试了学生通过阅读纯文本或观看图片是否能更好地学习基本的物理和化学概念，结果发现每个人都在图片的帮助下做得更好。



16. 为什么心理学家和教育家要研究学习风格？

A）对不同类型的学习者进行分类。

B）找出学生更喜欢学什么。

C）了解人脑的机制。

D）看它们是否是影响学习的固有特征。

### Recording 2

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.





19. A) Not playing a role in a workplace revolution.

B) Not benefiting from free-market capitalism.

C) Not earning enough money to provide for the family.

D) Not spending enough time on family life and leisure.

20. A) People would be working only fifteen hours a week now.

B) The balance of power in the workplace would change.

C) Technological advances would create many new jobs.

D) Most workers could afford to have a house of their own.

21. A) Loss of workers’ personal dignity.

B) Deprivation of workers’ creativity.

C) Deterioration of workers’ mental health.

D) Unequal distribution of working hours.







Free market capitalism hasn’t freed us; It has trapped us. It’s imperative for us to embrace a workplace revolution. (19)We’re unlikely to spend our last moments regretting that we didn’t spend enough of our lives slaving away at work. We may instead find ourselves feeling guilty about the time we didn’t spend watching our children grow all with our loved ones, or travelling or on the cultural or leisure suits that bring us happiness.

Unfortunately, the average full time employee in the world works 42 hours a week. Over a 3rd of the time we’re awake. Some of our all too precious time is being stolen. Office workers do around 2 billion hours of unpaid overtime each year. So it’s extremely welcome that some government coalitions have started looking into potentially cutting the working week to four days. The champions of free market capitalism promised their way of life would bring us freedom, but it wasn’t freedom at all. From the lack of secure, affordable housing to growing job insecurity and rising personal debt, the individual is trapped.

Nine decades ago, (20)leading economists predicted that technological advances and rising productivity would mean that would be working a 15-hour week by now: that target has been somewhat missed. Here is the most malignant threat to our personal freedom, particularly as the balance of power in the workplace has been shifted so dramatically from worker to boss. A huge portion of our lives involves the surrender of our freedom and personal autonomy. It’s time in which we are directed by the needs and desires of others, and denied the right to make our own choices.

That’s bad for us. It’s hardly surprising that (21)over half a million workers suffer from work -related mental health conditions each year or that 15.4 million working days were lost to work related stress last year, a jump of nearly a quarter. Yes, they’re all those who, far from being overworked, actually seek more hours. But a shorter working week would enable us to redistribute hours from the overworked to the under worked. We need to look at ways of cutting the working week without slashing living standards.

After all world's workers have already suffered the worst deduction in wages since the early 18 hundreds. And cutting the working week would be conducive to the individual, giving millions of workers more time to spend as they see fit.



19. What do people often feel guilty about according to the speaker?

20. What did leading economists predict 90 years ago?

21. What is the result of denying workers’ right to make their own choices?





自由市场资本主义并没有解放我们，反而困住了我们。我们必须进行一场职场革命。我们不太可能在生命的最后时刻去后悔没有花足够的时间在工作上。相反，我们可能会自己感到愧疚，因为我们没有花足够的时间看着我们的孩子成长，或与爱人相处，或去旅行，更没有时间去实现能为我们带来愉悦的文化追求和休闲而感到内疚。不幸的是，全球全职员工平均每周工作42小时——超过我们醒着的时间的三分之一。一些我们非常珍视的时间都被偷走了。办公室职员每年无偿加班约20亿小时。因此，当有些政府联盟开始考虑将每周的工作日调整为4天的时候，受到了人们的极大欢迎。

自由市场资本主义的拥护者们承诺，他们的生活方式将给我们带来自由，但那根本不是自由。从缺少可靠、能负担得起的住房到与日俱增的职业危机和个人债务，人们陷人了困境。90年前，几位经济学泰斗预测：技术的进步和生产率的提高意味着到现在我们将每周工作15个小时。这一目标多少有些偏离。

这是对我们个人自山最严重的威胁，尤其是当工作场所的权力平衡已戏剧性地从工人转移到老板身上的情况下。我们生活的很大一部分涉及到放弃我们的自由和个人自主权。现在是我们被他人的需要和欲望所指挥的时候，我们被剥夺了自己做出选择的权利。这对我们很不利。每年有超过50万的工人患有工作引起的心理疾病，这一点也不奇怪。去年，1540万个工作日因工作压力而浪费，数量几乎增加了四分之一。

是的，他们都是那些非但没有过度工作，反而要求更多工作时间的人。但更短的工作周将使我们把工作时间从过度重新分配到不足。我们需要想办法在不降低生活水平的情况下减少工作时间。总之，工人们已经遭受了自18世纪初以来最严重的减薪。减少每周的工作时间将有利于个人，这样能给数百万工人更多的时间，正如他们所希望的那样。



19．根据讲话者所说，人们经常对什么感到内疚？

A）没有在职场革命中发挥作用。

B）没有从自由市场资本主义中受益。

C）没有足够的钱养家。

D）没有花足够的时间在家庭生活和休闲上。

21.剥夺工人自主选择的权利的结果是什么？

A）工人个人尊严的丧失。

B）工人的创造力被剥夺。

C)工人心理健康恶化。

D）工作时间分配不均。

B) It is now the biggest and busiest airport in Europe.

C) It has become something of a joke among Germans.

D) It has become a typical symbol of German efficiency.

23. A) The city’s airports are outdated.

25. A) Tourism industry in Berlin suffers.

B) All kinds of equipment gets rusted.

C) Huge maintenance costs accumulate.

D) Complaints by local residents increase.





Today I’m going to talk about Germany’s dream airport in Berlin. The airport looks exactly like every other major modern airport in Europe, except for one big problem. More than seven years after it was originally supposed to open, it still stands empty. Germany is known for its efficiency and refined engineering, but when it comes to its new ghost airport, this reputation could not be further from the truth. Plagued by long delays, perpetual mismanagement, and ever saw ring costs, (22)the airport has become something of a joke among Germans and a source of frustration for local politicians, business leaders and residents alike.

Planning for the new airport began in 1989. At the time, it became clear that (23) the newly reunified Berlin would need a modern airport with far greater capacity than its existing airports. The city broke ground on the new airport in 2006. The first major sign of problems came in summer 2010, when the construction corporation pushed the opening from October 2011 to June 2012. In 2012, the city planned an opening ceremony. But less than a month before hand, inspectors found significant problems with the fire safety system and push the opening back again to 2013.

It wasn’t just the smoke system. (24)Many other major problems subsequently emerged. More than 90 meters of cable were incorrectly installed. 4000 doors were wrongly numbered. Escalators were too short. There was a shortage of check in desks. So why were so many problems discovered, didn’t the airport corporation decide to give up on the project and start over? The reason is simple. People are often hesitant to terminate a project when they’ve already invested time or resources into it, even if it might make logical sense to do so.

The longer the delays continued, the more problems inspectors found. Leadership of the planning corporation has changed hands nearly as many times as the opening date has been pushed back. Initially, rather than appointing a general contractor to run the project, the corporation decided to manage it themselves. Despite lack of experience with an undertaking of that scale. To compound the delays, (25)the unused airport is resulting in massive costs. Every month it remains unopened costs between nine and 10 million euros. Assuming all goes well, the airport should open in October 2020, but the still empty airport stands as the biggest embarrassment to Germany’s reputation for efficiency and a continuing drain on city and state resources.

今天我要讲的是德国柏林的梦幻机场。这个机场和欧洲其他大型现代化机场看起来一模一样，除了一个大问题：七年多之后，它仍然是空的。在它原定开放之日的七年多之后，它仍然是空的。

德国以其高效和精致的工程而闻名，但说到它的新幽灵机场，这种名声就大错特错了。由于长时间的延误，长期的管理不善，以及高昂的成本，该机场已经成为德国人的笑柄，也成为当地政客、商业领袖和居民的失望之源。

新机场的规划始于1989年。当时，重新统一后的柏林明显需要一个比现有机场容量大得多的现代机场。这座城市在2006年破土动工兴建新机场。第一次问题的主要迹象出现在2010年夏天，当时建筑总公司将开业时间从2011年10月推迟到2012年6月。2012年，柏林原计划举办开幕式。但在原定日期的不到一个月前，检查人员发现了消防安全系统有重大问题，并将开放时间推迟到2013年。不仅仅是烟雾报警系统有问题。随后出现了许多重大问题。总计超过90米的电缆安装不正确，4000扇门的编号错误，自动扶梯太短了，登机手续办理台不够用。

为什么在出现了这么多问题的情况下机场公司没有决定放弃这个项目重新开始呢？原因很简单。当人们已经在项目上投人了时间或资源时，他们常常会犹豫是否要终止这个项目，即使这样做是合乎逻辑的。

拖延得越久，检查员发现的问题就越多。规划公司的领导层人员 变更次数几乎和开业日期被推迟的次数一样多。起初，公司决定自己管理这个项目，而不是指定一个总承包商来管理这个项目，尽管他们缺乏这种规模的项目经验。比延误更糟的是，未使用的机场造成了巨大的成本开销。每月的   花费在900万到1000万欧元之间>假设一切顺利，该机场将于2020年10月开放，但仍然空空如也的机场是德国效率声誉的最大耻辱，也是城市和国家资源的持续损失。
