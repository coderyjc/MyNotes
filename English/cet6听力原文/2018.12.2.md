B) They are mostly taken by her mom.   D) They record her fond memories.





M: [1] Do you mind taking my photo with the statue over there? I think it will make a great shot.

W: Sure, no worries. You’re always taking photos. What do you do with all the photos you take?

M: Well, don’t laugh. [2] My dream is to become an online celebrity of sorts.

W: You are not serious, are you?

M: I am, completely. I just got the idea a few months ago after posting some holiday photos on my social media accounts. A lot of people liked my photos and started asking me for travel tips. So I figured I’d give it a go. I post a lot on social media anyway. So I’ve got nothing to lose.

W: I guess that’s true. So what do you have to do to become Internet famous?

M: Surprisingly a lot more than I did as a hobby. [3] Recently, I’ve been spending a lot more time editing photos, posting online and clearing storage on my phone. It’s always full now.

W: That doesn’t sound like too much work.

M: Well, there’s more to it. I spent all last weekend researching what topics are popular, what words to use in captions and similar accounts to follow. It really was a lot to take in. And I was up well past midnight. I’d say it’s paying off though. I increased the number of people following my accounts by 15% already.

W: That is impressive. I guess I never thought much about all the effort behind the scene. [4] Now that I think about it, there’s always something wrong with my photos as it is—half smiles, closed eyes, messy hair. I hope you have better luck than I do. Then again, I think the only person interested in my photos is my mom.

男：你介意帮我在雕像那边拍张照片吗？我想这会是一张很棒的照片。

女：当然，没问题。你一直在拍照片。你如何处理所有你拍的照片呢？

男：哦，别笑话我。我的梦想是成为某种意义上的网红。

女：你不是认真的，是吧？

男：我是的，十分认真。几个月前，我在社交媒体账户上发布了一些度假的照片，很多人喜欢我拍的照片，而且开始询问我一些旅行攻略，我就开始有这一念头了。于是我想试试。不管怎样，我在社交媒体上发布了大量的照片。而且我也没有什么损失。

女：那倒是真的。那么，你要怎么做才能在网上成名呢？

男：令人惊讶的是，这比我当作一个爱好要投入的多得多。最近我已经花费了大量时间编辑图片、在线发布，以及清理手机的存储空间。内存总是满的。

女：这听起来工作量也不是很大。

男：嗯，不止这些工作。上周末我花了一天的时间搜寻了什么话题比较受欢迎，在标题中该使用哪些词，以及追踪类似的账户。真的有很多工作要做。而且我一直忙到半夜。然而，我得说结果很好。关注我账户的人数增加了15%。

女：这让人钦佩。我想我从未多想过这些场景背后所付出的努力。因为我好好想想，我的照片事实上总是有此问题的似笑非笑、紧闭的双眼、凌乱的头发，我希望你比我的运气好一些。而且，我觉得唯一对我的照片感兴趣的人是我妈妈。

M: [5] Good evening and welcome to Physics Today. Here we interview some of the greatest minds in physics as they help us to understand some of the most complicated theories. Today, I’m very pleased to welcome Dr. Melissa Phillips, professor of theoretical physics. She’s here to tell us a little about what it is she studies. Dr. Phillips, you seem to study everything.

W: I guess that would be fair to say [6] I spent most of my time studying the Big Bang theory and where our universe came from.

M: Can you tell us a little about that?

W: [7] Well, I’m very interested in why the universe exists at all.That may sound odd, but the fact is at the moment of the Big Bang, both matter and anti-matter were created for a short time, and I mean just a fraction of a second. The whole universe was a super-hot soup of radiation filled with these particles. So what’s baffled scientists for so long is “why is there a universe at all?”

M: That’s because matter and anti-matter are basically opposites of each other. They are exactly alike except that they have opposite electrical charges. So when they collide, they destroy each other?

W: Exactly. So during the first few moments of the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and very small. Matter and the now more exotic anti-matter would have had little space to avoid each other. This means that they should have totally wiped each other out, leaving the universe completely barren.

M: [8] But a recent study seems to point to the fact that when matter and anti-matter were first created, there were slightly more particles of matter, which allowed the universe we all live in to form?

W: [8] Exactly. Because there was slightly more matter, the collisions quickly depleted all the anti-matter and left just enough matter to create stars, planets and eventually us.





Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

5. What does the man say is physics today?

6. What is the woman physicist’s main research area?

7. What is the woman interested in?

8. What seems to be the finding of the recent study?





男：晚上好，欢迎大家来到《今日物理学》。我们采访了一些物理学领域的大师，他们帮助我们理解一些最复杂的理论。今天，非常欢迎理论物理学教授梅莉莎·菲利普斯博士。她将告诉我们一些她研究的相关内容。菲利普斯博士，您似乎什么都研究。

女：我想可以很公平地说，我花费了大量的时间研究大爆炸理论，以及我们的宇宙从何而来。

男：您能为我们讲述一些相关内容吗?

女：好的，我对宇宙究竟如何存在非常感兴趣。这可能听起来很奇怪，但事实上在大爆炸的那一刻，在短时间内产生了物质和反物质，我的意思是一眨眼的工夫。整个宇宙就是充满这些颗粒的超级热辐射汤。于是，长期以来困扰科学家的问题是究竟为什么要有一个宇宙?

男：那是因为物质和反物质基本上是彼此相反的。它们完全相同，只是具有相反的电荷。所以当它们相碰撞时，它们会摧毁彼此。

女：正是如此。因此，在大爆炸发生的最初几分钟内，宇宙非常炎热，而且非常小。物质以及更奇特的反物质几乎没有相互避开的空间。这意味着它们应该完全摧毁了彼此，留下宇宙一片荒芜。

男：但是最近的一项研究似乎指出了这样一个事实，即，当物质和反物质最初被创造时，物质的粒子会稍微多一些，这使我们所居住的宇宙能够形成？

女：正是因为物质稍微多一点，碰撞快速耗尽了所有的反物质，留下了足够的物质来创造恒星、行星，以及最终创造了我们。

### Passage 1



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.



9. A) She found herself speaking a foreign language.

B) She woke up speaking with a different accent.

C) She found some symptoms of her illness gone.

D) She woke up finding herself in another country.



10. A) It is usually caused by a stroke or brain injury.

B) It has not yet found any effective treatment.

C) It leaves the patient with a distorted memory.

D) It often happens to people with speech defects.



11. A) British.   B) Irish.

C) Russian.   D)  Australian.





In this week’s edition of special series on Bizarre Medical Conditions, there is a report of the case of Michelle Myers. [9]Myers is an American woman who woke up one day speaking with a British accent, even though she’s lived in the United States all her life. In 2015, Myers went to bed with a terrible headache. She woke up sounding like someone from England. Her British accent has remained for the past two years. Previously, Myers had woken up speaking in Irish and Australian accents. However, on both of those occasions, the accents lasted for only a week.

Myers has been diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome. It’s a disorder in which a person experiences a sudden change to their speech so that they sound like they’re speaking in a foreign accent. [10]The condition is most often caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury. Although people with the syndrome have intelligible speech, their manner of speaking is altered in terms of timing and tongue placement, which may distort their pronunciation. The result is that they may sound foreign when speaking their native language. It’s not clear whether Myers has experienced a stroke or other brain damage, but she also has a separate medical condition, which can result in loose joints, easily bruised skin and other problems.

Foreign Accent Syndrome is rare, with only about 60 cases reported within the past century. [11] However, a different American woman reportedly spoke with the Russian accent in 2010 after she fell down the stairs and hit her head.





Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.

9. What happened to Michelle Myers one day?

10. What does the passage say about foreign accent syndrome?

11. What accent did another American woman speak with after a head injury?







在本周的“奇怪医疗状况”特别系列报道中，有一篇关于米歇尔·迈尔斯案例的报告。迈尔斯是一名美国妇女，尽管她这一生都生活在美国，但某天她醒来之后说话带英国口音。2015年，迈尔斯睡觉时头痛欲裂。她醒来时说话就像是英国来的人。她的口音持续了两年。在之前，迈尔斯醒来时曾说话带爱尔兰和澳大利亚口音。然而，这两种情况的口音都只持续了一周的时间。

迈尔斯被诊断出患有外国口音综合症。在这种紊乱情况下，某人会经历语音上的突然转变，听起来好像他们在用外国口音说话。这种情况通常是由中风或创伤性脑损伤引起的。尽管患有该综合症的人说话能让人听得懂，但他们的说话方式在调速和舌头放置方面会发生变化，这可能会使他们的发音变得扭曲。结果就是他们在说母语的时候，可能听起来像外国口音。迈尔斯是否经历过中风或其他大脑损伤不得而知，但她也有一种不同的医疗状况，导致了关节松动、皮肤容易擦伤以及其他问题。

外国口音综合症很罕见，在过去一个世纪内仅报告了约60例。然而，据报道，美国另一名女性在2010年摔下楼梯头部受到撞击之后，她说话带俄罗斯口音。



9. 有一天米歇尔·迈尔斯发生了什么事？

A) 她发现她在说外语。

B) 她醒来之后，用一种不同的口音讲话。

C) 她发现疾病的一些症状消失了。

D) 她醒来发现自己在另一个国家。



10. 本文如何评论外国口音综合症？

A) 它通常是因中风或大脑损伤造成的。

B) 目前尚未发现任何有效的治疗方法。

C) 它让病人记忆扭曲。

D) 它常常发生在语言能力缺陷的人身上。



11. 另一名头部受伤的美国女性说话的口音是什么？

A) 英国。   B) 爱尔兰。

C) 俄罗斯。   D) 澳大利亚。

### Passage 1

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.



12. A) Water sports.   C) Stories about women swimmers.

B) Racing in rivers.   D) Books about swimming.



13. A) She succeeded in swimming across the English Channel.

B) She published a guide to London’s best swimming spots.

C) She told her story of adventures to some young swimmers.

D) She wrote a book about the history of swimwear in the UK.



14. A) They loved vacationing on the seashore.

B) They had a unique notion of modesty.

C) They were prohibited from swimming.

D) They were fully dressed when swimming.



15. A) She designed lots of appropriate swimwear for women.

B) She once successfully competed against men in swimming.

C) She was the first woman to swim across the English Channel.

D) She was an advocate of women’s right to swim in public pools.





There is something about water that makes it a good metaphor for life. That may be one reason why so many people find relief in swimming when life’s seas get rough. [12] And it goes some way towards explaining why books about swimming, in which people tackle icy lakes, race in rivers and overcome oceans while reflecting on their lives, have recently become so popular.

These books reflect a trend, particularly strong in Britain, where swimming in pools is declining, but more and more folks are opting for open water. “Wild swimming” seems to be especially popular among women. [13] Jenny Landreth recently published a guide to the best swimming spots in London. Her new book, Swell, interweaves her own story with a history of female pioneers who accomplished remarkable feats and paved the way for future generations.

Notions of modesty restricted women in the Victorian era, but they still swam. A “bathing machine” was rolled down to the seashore so women would not be seen in swimwear. In 1892, The Gentlewoman’s Book of Sport described a [14] woman swimming in a heavy dress, boots, hat, gloves and carrying an umbrella.

Eventually, swimming became freer. Mixed bathing was permitted on British beaches in 1901. Women won the right to swim in public pools, learned to swim properly, created appropriate swimwear and, in time, even competed against men. [15] The first woman to cross the English Channel was Gertrude Ederle. In 1926, she beat the record by almost two hours and her father rewarded her with a red sports car.



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.

12. What has become so popular recently?

13. What did Jenny Landreth do recently?

14. What do we learn about women in the Victorian era?

15. What does the passage say about Gertrude?







水的一些特质让它成为生活中一种很好的比喻说法。这可能就是很多人在生活变得艰难时，游泳会觉得放松的一个原因。这在某种程度上也解释了为什么关于游泳的书近来变得如此流行，这些书的主题是有关人们挑战冰冷的湖泊，在河流中比赛以及征服海洋，同时反思自己的人生。

这些书反映了英国一种特别强烈的趋势，那就是在游泳池游泳的趋势在下滑，越来越多的人选择开放水域。而且游泳似乎尤其受女性欢迎。珍妮·兰德雷斯最近出版了一本伦敦最佳游泳地点的指南。她的新书将历史上女性先驱编织成她自己的故事，这些女性先驱取得过令人瞩目的成就，为后代铺平了道路。

在维多利亚时代，庄重的观念束缚了女性，但她们仍然游泳。更衣车被推到海边，这样在1892年时，就不会看见穿泳装的妇女。《文雅的女性运动书籍》中，描述了一个女人穿着厚重的衣服、靴子，戴着帽子、手套，而且打着伞游泳。

最终，游泳变得更加自由。英国海滩允许混合沐浴。1901年，妇女赢得了在公共泳池游泳的权利，学习正确的游泳方式，创造了适宜的泳装，以及最后与男性竞争的权利。第一位横渡英吉利海峡的女性是格特鲁德·艾德莉。1926年，她以近两个小时的成绩打破了记录，她的父亲奖励了她一辆红色跑车。



12. 最近什么颇受欢迎？

A) 水上运动。

B) 在河中比赛。

C) 女性游泳者的故事。

D) 有关游泳的书籍。



13. 珍妮·兰德雷斯最近做了什么？

A) 她成功游泳横渡英吉利海峡。

B) 她出版了一本伦敦最佳游泳地点的指南。

C) 她给一些年轻的游泳者讲述她冒险的故事。

D) 她写了一本关于英国泳装历史的书。



14. 有关维多利亚时代的女性，我们了解到了些什么？

A) 她们喜欢在海滨度假。

B) 她们有着独特的庄重观念。

C) 她们被禁止游泳。

D) 她们游泳时穿戴齐全。



15. 本文如何评价格特鲁德？

A) 她为女性设计了许多适宜的泳装。

B) 她曾在游泳竞赛中赢了男性。

C) 她是第一位横渡英吉利海峡的女性。

D) 她是女性享有在公共泳池游泳权利的倡导者。

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16. A) Build a machine that can detect lies.

B) Develop a magnetic brain scanner.

C) Test the credibility of court evidence.

D) Win people’s complete trust in them.



17. A) They are optimistic about its potential.

B) They are sceptical of its reliability.

C) They think it is but business promotion.

D) They celebrate it with great enthusiasm.



18. A) It is not to be trusted at all.   C) It may intrude into people’s privacy.

B) It does not sound economical.   D) It may lead to overuse in court trials.





Today I’m going to talk about a very special kind of person. Psychologists call them “masters of deception,” those rare individuals with a natural ability to tell with complete confidence when someone is telling a lie. [16] For decades, researchers and law enforcement agencies have tried to build a machine that will do the same thing.

Now a company in Massachusetts says that by using magnetic brain scans they can determine with 97% accuracy whether someone is telling the truth. They hope that the technology will be cleared for use in American courts by early next year. But is this really the ultimate tool for you, the lawyers of tomorrow? [17] You’ll not find many brain scientists celebrating this breakthrough. The company might be very optimistic, but the ability of their machine to detect deception has not provided credible proof. That’s because the technology has not been properly tested in real-world situations. In life, there are different kinds of lies and diverse context in which they’re told. These differences may elicit different brain responses. Does their hypothesis behind the test apply in every case? We don’t know the answer, because studies done on how reliable this machine is have not yet been duplicated. Much more research is badly needed.

Whether the technology is eventually deemed reliable enough for the courts will ultimately be decided by the judges. Let’s hope they’re wise enough not to be fooled by a machine that claims to determine truthfulness at the flick of a switch. They should also be sceptical of the growing tendency to try to reduce all human traits and actions to the level of brain activity. Often, they do not map that easily.

Moreover, understanding the brain is not the same as understanding the mind. Some researchers have suggested that thoughts cannot properly be seen as purely “internal.” Instead, thoughts make sense only in reference to the individual’s external world. So while there may be insights to be gained from matching behavior to brain activity, those insights will not necessarily lead to justice in a court of law. Problems surround the use of machines to spot deception, at least until it has been rigorously tested.

[18] A high-tech test that can tell when a person is not telling the truth sounds too good to be true. And when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.

16. What have researchers and law enforcement agencies tried to do?

17. How do many brain scientists respond to the Massachusetts companies so called technological breakthrough?

18. What does the speaker think of using a high tech test to determine whether a person is telling the truth?





今天我要谈谈一类非常特别的人，心理学家称他们为“欺骗大师”。他们是天生具有一种能力的罕见人士，说谎时能胸有成竹地讲述。几十年来，研究人员和执法机构尝试建造一种能做同样事情的机器。

如今，马萨诸塞州的一家公司表示，通过使用磁脑扫描，他们可以确定是否有人说实话，准确率高达97%。他们期望该技术明年年初能得到法院的批准使用。但这真的是你的终极工具吗？明日律师？你并不会发现很多大脑科学家在庆祝这一突破。该公司可能非常乐观，但他们的机器检测欺骗的能力并没有提供可靠的证据。那是因为该技术尚未在现实世界的情境下进行适宜的测试。在生活中，他们会被告知各种不同类型的谎言，以及各种各样的内容。这些差异可能引起不同的大脑反应。在测试背后的假设是否适用于所有情况呢？我们不知道答案，因为尚未重复进行有关该机器可靠性的研究。所以迫切需要更多的研究。

这项技术最终是否能被法庭认为足够可靠，将由法官们决定。让我们期望他们足够明智，不要被一台宣称轻轻旋一下开关就可以确定真实性的机器所愚弄。对于试图将所有人类特征和行为降低到大脑活动水平的增长趋势，他们应持怀疑态度。他们常常不能轻易地勘查它们。

此外，理解大脑和理解思维并不是一样的。一些研究人员建议说，思想不能完全被视为纯粹的内在。相反，思想只有在涉及个人外部世界时才有意义。因此，虽然可以通过匹配行为与大脑活动获得见解，但这些见解并不一定会导致法庭上的正义。使用机器发现欺骗问题重重，至少在经过严格测试之前。

判断某人是否有说实话的高科技测试听起来好得令人难以置信。而且当某事听起来好得令人难以置信时，通常就是不太真实。



16. 研究人员和执法机构试图做什么？

A) 建造一台可以检测谎言的机器。

B) 研发一台磁脑扫描仪。

C) 测试法院证据的可信性。

D) 赢得人们对他们的完全信任。



17. 许多大脑科学家如何回应马萨诸塞州所谓的技术突破？

A) 他们认为它的潜力颇为乐观。

B) 他们对其可信性持怀疑态度。

C) 他们认为它是商业促销。

D) 他们以极大的热忱庆祝。



18. 发言者如何评价使用高科技测试来确定一个人是否说实话？

A) 根本不可信。

B) 听起来不经济实惠。

C) 它可能侵犯人们的隐私。

D) 可能导致在法庭审讯中过度使用。

### Recording 2

Last week I attended a research workshop on an island in the South Pacific. Thirty people were present and all except me came from the island, called Makelua, in the nation of Vanuatu. They live in 16 different communities and speak 16 distinct languages. In many cases, you could stand at the edge of one village and see the outskirts of the next community. [19] Yet the residents of each village speak a completely different language. According to recent work by my colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, this island, just 100 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, is home to speakers of perhaps 40 different indigenous languages.

Why so many? We could ask the same question of the entire globe. People don’t speak one universal language, or even a handful. Instead, today our species collectively speaks over 7, 000 distinct languages, and these languages are not spread randomly across the planet. [20] For example, far more languages are found in tropical regions than in the mild zones. The tropical island of New Guinea is home to over 900 languages. Russia, 20 times larger, has 105 indigenous languages. Even within the tropics, language diversity varies widely. For example, the 250,000 people who live on Vanuatu’s 80 islands speak 110 different languages, but in Bangladesh, a population 600 times greater speaks only 41 languages.

How come humans speak so many languages? And why are they so unevenly spread across the planet? As it turns out, we have few clear answers to these fundamental questions about how humanity communicates. Most people can easily brainstorm possible answers to these intriguing questions. They hypothesize that language diversity must be about history, cultural differences, mountains or oceans dividing populations. But when our diverse team of researchers from six different disciplines and eight different countries began to review what was known, we were shocked that only a dozen previous studies had been done, including one we ourselves completed on language diversity in the Pacific. These prior efforts all examined the degree to which different environmental, social and geographic variables correlated with the number of languages found in a given location. [21] The results varied a lot from one study to another, and no clear patterns emerged. The studies also ran up against many methodological challenges, the biggest of which centered on the old statistical saying—correlation does not equal causation.



Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.

19. What does the speaker say about the island of Makelua?

20. What do we learn from the talk about languages in the world?

21. What have the diverse team of researchers found about the previous studies on language diversity?





上周，我参加了在南太平洋岛屿举行的一场研讨会。有30人出席，除我之外，其他所有人都来自瓦努阿图国的马卡卢洼岛。他们生活在16个不同的社区，讲16种不同的语言。在许多情况下，你可以站在一个村庄的边缘，看到隔壁社区的郊区。然而，每个村庄的居民都说完全不同的语言。根据我在马克斯普朗克人类科学史研究所同事最新工作可知，该岛长100公里，宽20公里，是40种不同本土语言的发源地。

为什么这么多？我们可以问整个地球同一个问题。人们不会说一种通用语言，甚至不会说极少数几种语言。相反，如今我们人类全体讲7000多种不同的语言，而这些语言并非随机地散布在整个地球上。例如，热带地区的语言比温带地区的语言多得多。新几内亚的热带岛屿拥有超过900种语言。俄罗斯比新几内亚大20倍，有105种本土语言。即使在热带地区，语言多样性也有很大差异。例如，25万人生活在瓦努阿图80个岛屿上，他们讲110种不同的语言。但在孟加拉国，人口增加了600倍，但他们只说41种语言。

人类怎么说这么多语言？为什么如此不均勻地分布在整个地球上？事实证明，我们对于人类如何沟通的这些基本问题几乎没有明确的答案。大多数人可以轻松地就这些有趣的问题集思广益可能的答案。他们假设语言多样性一定与历史、文化差异、山脉或海洋分隔人口有关。但是，当我们来自6个不同学科和8个不同国家的多元化研究团队开始回顾已知事件时，我们感到震惊的是，之前只进行了12项研究，其中包括我们自己已经完成的太平洋语言多样性研究。这些先前的努力都研究了不同环境、社会和地理变量与在给定地点中发现的多种语言相关联的程度。[21]从一项研究到另一项研究，它们的结果也大相径庭，并没有出现明确的模式。这些研究还遇到了许多方法学上的挑战，其中最大的挑战集中在旧的统计学上相关性不等于因果关系。



19. 有关马卡卢洼岛，讲话者说了些什么？

A) 大多数居民讲几种语言。

B) 一些本土语言正在消失。

C) 每一个村庄都讲一种完全不同的语言。

D) 世界上的研究人员都对其语言感兴趣。



20. 我们从有关世界上语言的讨论中了解到了些什么？

A) 它们随机地分布在世界各地。

B) 一些语言比其他语言更难学习。

C) 热带地区的语言比气候温和地区的语言要多。

D) 它们在多方面互相丰富和影响。



21. 对于之前的语言多样性研究，多元化研究团队有何发现？

A) 他们使用不同的方式收集和分析数据。

B) 他们确认了语言分布的独特模式。

C) 他们的结论与最初的假设不符。

D) 对于语言多样性的原因没有结论性解释。

We often hear people say that America is a land of opportunity, a country built on hope to aspire the greatness on the American dream. But is the dream as we once knew it dying? [22] Today’s demographics show that the middle-class is disappearing and now the richest 1% of the population has mastered more wealth than the bottom 90%. [23]Once upon a time, Americans thought that if they worked hard enough, even in the phase of adversity, they would be rewarded with success. These days, though, the divide between rich and poor is greater than it has ever been.

The question is, what is it going to take to change things? Maybe one day soon real change will actually be made in our nation and the gap will be eradicated. But what happens in the meantime? Is there something that we can do to help close the gap? Is there something that we can do to prove that a little compassion goes a long way? If we want to fix the problem of the income gap, first, we have to understand it. It is a grim reality that you can have one person who only makes around $ 13, 000 a year, or across town, another is making millions. For me, it is kind of astonishing. [24] And if you ask low-income people what’s the one thing that will change their life, they’ll say “a full-time job.” That’s all they aspire to. So why is it so difficult for so many people to find employment? It partly comes down to profit- driven business models that are built around low- wage work and part-time jobs that don’t provide benefits. [25] Businesses, in order to boost profits, hire employees as part-time workers only. This means they are paid the lowest legal wage and receive no health care or other benefits provided to full-time employees.

Simultaneously, technological advancement and a global economy has reduced the demand for well-paying blue-collar jobs here in the United States. The cumulative effect of these two factors is that many Americans are forced to take two or more part-time jobs, just to make ends meet. What has become obvious to me when it comes to the income gap is that there needs to be an opportunity for the people at the bottom to push them back up and push them into the middle-class to give them hope in their lives.

我们经常听到人们说美国是一个充满机遇的国度，建立在追求“美国梦”这个伟大的希望之上的国家。但我们曾所知的梦正在消亡吗？现今的人口统计数据显示，中产阶级正在消失，现在最富有的1%的人口掌握着比底层90%的人口更多的财富。曾几何时，美国人认为只要他们足够努力工作，即使处在逆境之中，他们也会获得成功。然而，如今，贫富差距比以往任何时候都大。

问题是，改变这些事情要采取什么措施呢？也许不久的某天，我们的国家将会真正实现变革，这种差距将被消除。但在此期间会发生什么？我们能做些什么来帮助弥补差距呢？我们能做什么来证明一点点的同理心就能发挥很大作用？如果想解决收入差距的问题，必须了解它。有人一年只赚1.3万美金，而在城市另一端，有人年收入过百万，这是一个严峻的现实。对我而言，有些令人惊讶。[24]如果你问低收入人群会改变他们生活的一件事，他们会说“全职工作”。这就是他们所渴望的。那么为什么这么多人找工作如此困难呢？部分归结为以利润为导向的商业模式，这些商业模式建立在低薪资的工作以及不提供福利的兼职工作之上。[25]为了提高利润，企业雇用的员工只有兼职工人。这意味着他们只有最低的法定工资，不享有为全职员工提供的医疗保健或其他福利待遇。

同时，技术进步和全球经济减少了美国对高薪蓝领工作的需求。这两个因素的累积效应是，为了维持生计，许多美国人被迫从事两份或多份兼职工作。在收入差距问题上，我觉得显而易见的是，需要有将底层人民往上推，将他们推至中产阶级，给予他们生活希望的机会。
