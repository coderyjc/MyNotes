# AI discrimination is a bigger risk than human extinction

**文章背景**

素有“欧盟数字沙皇”之称的欧盟委员会执行副主席、反垄断事务主管Margrethe Vestager表示，与导致人类灭绝相比，人工智能(AI)发展带来的歧视问题在眼下正更为紧迫。Vestager在本周接受媒体采访时表示，需要设置“护栏”来应对该项技术背后的最大风险。她指出，当人工智能被用来帮助做出可能影响人类生活的重大决定时，这可能面临关键风险——例如决定一些人士是否可以申请抵押贷款。按照日程安排，欧洲议会周三将就拟议的《人工智能法案》修正案进行表决，之后将开始与欧盟成员国代表就法律的最终形式进行谈判。此前，一些业内专家曾警告称，人工智能的无序发展可能会导致人类灭绝。但Vestager表示，相比于上述担忧，人工智能发展面临的更紧迫问题是有可能放大偏见或歧视，这些偏见或歧视可能会包含在来自互联网的大量数据中，并用于培训人工智能模型及相应工具。

**正文**

【Para.1】Discrimination is a bigger threat posed by artificial intelligence than possible extinction of the human race, according to the ==EU’s competition commissioner.== Margrethe Vestager said although the existential risk from advances in AI may be a concern, it was unlikely, whereas discrimination from the technology was a real problem.

【Para.2】She told the BBC “==guardrails==” were needed for AI, including for situations where it was being used for decisions that could affect livelihoods, such as ==mortgage== applications or access to social services. “Probably the risk of extinction may exist, but I think the likelihood is quite small. I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated against, they will not be seen as who they are,” she said.

【Para.3】“If it’s a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it’s social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you’re not being discriminated against because of your gender or your colour or your postal code.”

【Para.4】In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office is investigating whether AI systems are showing racial bias when dealing with job applications. Regulators are concerned that AI tools will could produce outcomes that disadvantage certain groups if they are not represented accurately or fairly in the datasets that they are trained and tested on.

【Para.5】Vestager’s concerns echo some tech experts who argue that fears over existential-level risk related to AI are ==overshadowing== more immediate risks such as AI-powered ==disinformation==. The competition chief said calls for a ==moratorium== on AI development, supported by Elon Musk and other senior figures, was ==unenforceable==.

【Para.6】AI regulation needed to be “global affair”, Vestager said, but she warned that a ==UN==-style approach would be difficult to implement. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, has ==convened== a global AI safety summit for “==like-minded countries==” this autumn and tech executives such as the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk have called for global frameworks to regulate the technology.

【Para.7】“Let’s start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn’t hold our breath,” Vestager said. “We should do what we can here and now.” The EU is working on legislation to oversee development and implementation of AI systems, which groups AI technology into four risk groups: unacceptable risk; high risk; limited risk; and minimal risk. AI systems overseeing credit scores and essential public services come into the high-risk category, meaning “clear requirements” will be set for those systems.

【Para.8】Vestager’s ==interjection== came as the Irish Data Protection Commission blocked Google from launching its Bard chatbot in the EU over privacy concerns. The DPC, which is the chief European regulator for the California company, said it had not received sufficient information about how the tools would comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.

【Para.9】Google had intended to launch Bard in Europe this week, months after the chatbot’s global release. Now, the regulator says, that will not happen. The DPC “had not had any detailed briefing nor sight of a data protection impact assessment or any supporting documentation at this point”, the deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told Politico in an interview.

【Para.10】A similar conflict happened in April, when the Italian regulator ordered the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, to pause operations in the country over data protection concerns. The Italian data protection authority said that there appeared to be “no legal basis ==underpinning== the massive collection and processing of personal data in order to ‘train’ the algorithms on which the platform relies”. OpenAI was eventually able to convince the regulator that it was in ==compliance== and relaunched services with limited changes.
