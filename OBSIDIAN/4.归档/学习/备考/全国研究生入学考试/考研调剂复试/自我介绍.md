各位老师好！很荣幸能够参加今天的面试！

我是闫竞存，来自于山东梁山，本科就读于石家庄铁道大学。接下来我将从以下三方面来介绍自己：一是课程学习，二是实践经历，三是未来规划。

在课程学习方面。我从大一开始就深刻地意识到了自学的重要性，怀着对计算机的热爱开始自学计算机专业知识，逐渐建立自己的知识体系，虽然中间走了很多弯路，踩了许多坑，但最终有了不小的收获。我目前的GPA为3.5，专业成绩排名前10%，并获得过五学期获得优秀学生奖学金。此外，在英语学习方面，我在大二的时候以584分的成绩通过了英语四级考试，并紧接着通过了英语六级考试，并在考研初试中获得了83分的成绩。

在课程学习之余，我将大部分经历用在了自己的实践能力提升上。我从大二开始学习web开发技术，搭建并不断完善自己的技术博客，在体会完整的项目开发流程不断总结学到的知识，并在此过程中拿下了两份软件著作权证书。在加强工程训练的同时，我也没有忘记算法的学习，在2021年拿到了蓝桥杯算法竞赛的省级二等奖。与此同时，我也积极参加科研训练项目来提升自己的能力。我参加了大学生创新训练项目并以国家级项目成功立项，项目名称为《基于云平台的铁路智能巡检系统》，通过云平台实现了维修工人，铁路巡检车和数据大屏的三位一体，不仅让铁路损坏的报告和维修变得及时，也方便了管理人员把控工作进度。我负责项目中移动APP，管理系统的搭建和数据大屏的设计与实现，经过我们项目小组的不懈努力，该项目最终以良好的成绩成功结题。

本科四年的学习将要结束，大部分的专业课程也已学习完毕，但是我发觉自己的知识体系还不够完善，对许多专业课程的理解还不够深入，许多学习方法也只是初窥门径，所以我希望继续攻读硕士研究生，甚至博士生。希望能在研究生阶段不断加强对专业知识的学习，并将所学的知识运用于实践当中，在自身能力不断增强的同时也希望为社会贡献出自己的绵薄之力，成为一名既懂得专业知识又能够将其运用于实践的人才。

谢谢！

Good morning/afternoon, It is my honor to be here for this interview. First of all,I'd like to introduce myself to you.My name is Yan Jingcun, my hometown is Jining, Shandong province.And I will graduate from the Computer Science department of Shijiazhuang Tiedao University.（基本信息，姓名，家乡，毕业院校，专业）

During my college years, I have made rapid and great progress in study, I realized the importance of self-learning when I was a freshman, so I began to learn computer science with great passion. My GPA is 3.5 and rank in the top 10% of my major. And  I won several scholarships each year. In terms of English learning, I passed CET-4 and CET-6 with a high sore in sophomore.（学习成绩，奖学金，英语能力）

As to my characters, just like my parents, I strive to be an friendly, modest and hard-working student.I will try my best to finish my goal no matter how difficult it is. Development is not only my major, but my interest. So in my spare time, I like learning web development and practice. I built my own technical blog and maintaining it, which not only improved my engineering skills, but also gave me a deeper understanding of computer language. While enhancing engineering training, I did not forget to learn algorithms, and won the provincial second prize of Blue Bridge Cup Algorithm Competition in 2021. In the meantime, I participated in the innovation training program for college students and successfully approved the national project named "Intelligent Railway Inspection System Based on Cloud Platform". I was responsible for the construction of mobile APP and management system and the design and implementation of data screen in the project. Through our hardwork, the project was successfully concluded with good results.（性格，项目，实践经历）

Finally, there must be many things to learn if I were enrolled into my ideal research field. I hope I can build up a systematic view of computer science. I will get more experience in practice and project. I am looking forward to making up a solid foundation for future profession which is based on three years of study here. I would be very honored if you could grant me the opportunity to study in this university. That's all about me. Thank you! （未来规划）
