The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
人类的声音：它是我们所有人都使用的乐器。它可能是世界上最强大的声音。它是唯一一个可以引发战争或说“我爱你”的声音。然而，许多人都有这样的经历：当他们讲话时，人们不听他们讲话。为什么呢？我们如何才能用有力的话语改变世界呢？


[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=33.45707406103516)
What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
我想要建议的是，有一些我们需要改变的习惯。我在这里为你们带来了七宗讲话的致命罪过，供大家欣赏。我并不是假装这是一个详尽的清单，但我认为这七个罪过是我们都可能陷入的大习惯。

[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=49.26458618501282)
First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
首先，是闲言碎语。对不在场的人说坏话。这不是一个好习惯，我们很清楚，那个说闲话的人，五分钟后，会开始对我们说闲话。

[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=60.882303085830685)
Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.
其次，是评判。我们知道一些人在谈话中就是这样，如果你知道自己被评判并被认为不够好，那就很难听别人说话。

[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=71.78454216975403)
Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"
第三，是消极情绪。你可能会陷入这种情绪中。我母亲在生命的最后几年变得非常消极，这很难听。我记得有一天，我对她说：“今天是10月1日”，她说：“我知道，这不是可怕吗？”

[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=87.56120118882751)
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.
当有人如此消极时，很难倾听他们说话。


[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=89.90864991798401)
And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.
还有另一种形式的消极情绪，抱怨。嗯，这是英国的国家艺术。我们抱怨天气，抱怨运动，抱怨政治，抱怨一切，但实际上，抱怨只会传播痛苦。它不会在世界上传播阳光和快乐。

[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=109.8653960038147)
Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.
借口。我们都遇到过这种人。也许我们都曾是这样的人。有些人总是把责任推给别人，不为自己的行为负责，再说话时，很难听。

[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=122.33338097138977)
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?
倒数第二，是夸大。夸大会贬低我们的语言。例如，如果我看到真正令人敬畏的事物，我会怎么称呼它？


[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=136.1380510743866)
And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.
然后，当然，这种夸大会演变成谎言，我们不想听那些我们知道在对我们说谎的人。

[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=143.75532610871886)
And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that.
最后，教条主义。混淆事实和观点。当这两个东西混为一谈时，你就是在听风。你知道，有人向你发射他们的观点，就好像它们是真实的。这很难倾听。


[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=160.33963904577638)
So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things.
所以这就是七宗讲话的致命罪过。我认为我们需要避免这些事情。但是是否有一种积极的思考方式呢？是的，有的。我想建议的是，如果我们想让我们的言辞有力量并改变世界，那么有四个真正强大的基石、基础，我们可以站在上面。幸运的是，这些东西拼成一个词。这个词是“欢呼”，它也有一个很好的定义。我不是说天上掉下来砸在你头上的那种“欢呼”。我说的是这个定义，热情地欢迎或赞扬，这正是我认为我们的话语如果站在这四个基石上会得到的接待。

[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=199.7789469408722)
So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail.
那么它们分别代表什么呢？看看你能否猜到。首先是H，诚实。当然，说话要真实，直截了当。A是真实性，就是做自己。我的一个朋友形容它为站在自己的真相中，我觉得这是个很美好的说法。I是正直，言出必行，实际上做你说过的事情，并且成为人们可以信赖的人。L是爱。我不是指浪漫的爱，但我是指祝愿别人好的心意，有两个原因。首先，我认为绝对的诚实可能不是我们想要的。我的天啊，你今天早上看起来真丑。也许这并不是必要的。当然，配以爱的温度，诚实是一件伟大的事情。但是，如果你真的希望某人好，很难同时对他们进行评判。我甚至不确定你能同时做这两件事。所以欢呼。

[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=256.33333893896486)
Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking.
现在这是你说的话，就像那首老歌，它是你说的话，也是你说话的方式。你有一个令人惊叹的工具箱。这个乐器令人难以置信，但很少有人打开过这个工具箱。现在我想和你一起在那里翻找一下，并找出一些你可能想要带走并玩耍的工具，这些工具将增加你的说话能力。

[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=279.3867702040863)
Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register.
注册，例如。现在，假声注册大部分时间可能并不是非常有用，但中间有一个注册。我不会对此对任何声音教练过于技术性地讲解。然而，你可以找到你的声音。所以，如果我在这里（鼻子上方）说话，你能听出不同。如果我在这里（喉咙处），也就是我们大多数时候说话的地方。但是如果你想要有力量，你需要在这里（胸部）说话。你听到区别了吗？我们投票给声音较低的政治家，这是真的，因为我们把深度与权力和权威联系在一起。这就是注册。

[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=315.67731592752074)
Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice.
然后是音色。这是你的声音感觉的方式。同样，研究表明，我们更喜欢丰富、平滑、温暖的声音，就像热巧克力一样。如果这不是你的特点，也不是世界末日，因为你可以训练。去找一个声音教练。而且通过呼吸、姿势和练习，你可以做一些了不起的事情来改善你的声音音色。


[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=338.21044401716614)
Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word "monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?
接着是韵律。我喜欢韵律。这是我们用来传达意义的歌唱，元语言。这是对话中意义的根本。如果没有任何韵律，只有单调的人是很难听的。这就是“单调”的由来。现在还有重复性的韵律出现，每个句子结束时都像是一个问题，而实际上并不是一个问题，而是一个陈述？


[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=369.6121258664856)
And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit.
Pace.
如果你一直重复这个，实际上限制了你通过韵律进行沟通的能力，我认为这很遗憾，所以让我们试着改变这个习惯。
速度。


[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=382.4984951564026)
I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful.
我可以通过快速说话而变得非常兴奋，或者我可以慢下来强调，当然，在那之后是我们的老朋友——沉默。在演讲中，沉默一点问题都没有，对吗？我们不必用“嗯”和“啊”来填充它。它可以非常有力量。

[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=403.1060231678467)
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.
当然，音高通常随着速度而指示激动，但你也可以通过音高来做到。你把我的钥匙放在哪里了？（更高的音高）你把我的钥匙放在哪里了？所以这两种交付方式的意义略有不同。

[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=415.9777290743866)
And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting,
最后是音量。（大声）通过使用音量，我可以变得非常兴奋。如果我吓到了任何人，我很抱歉。或者，通过变得非常安静，我可以让你真正集中注意力。有些人总是一直在广播。尽量不要这样做。那被称为“刻录”，这是在粗暴和不体贴地将你的声音强加给周围的人。这不好。


[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=435.1074500228882)
Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice.

[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=440.8501081907349)
Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice.
当然，这一切最重要的时候是当你有一些真正重要的事情要做的时候。也许是站在像这样的舞台上向人们发表讲话。也许是求婚，要求加薪，发表婚礼演讲。无论是什么，如果它真的很重要，你应该看看这个工具箱以及它将要运作的引擎，而没有引擎会在没有被热身的情况下正常工作。热身你的声音。

[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=467.42571296376036)
Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.
实际上，让我来告诉你如何做。你们想站起来一会吗？我要向你展示我每次演讲前都会做的六个声音热身练习。无论何时你要和任何重要的人说话，都要做这些练习。首先，举起手臂，深吸一口气，然后长出一口气，啊啊啊，就像那样。再来一次。啊啊啊，非常好。现在我们要热身我们的嘴唇，我们要说巴，巴，巴，巴，巴，巴，巴，巴。非常好。现在，像当你还是个孩子时一样，嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯。现在你的嘴唇应该活跃起来了。接下来我们要用夸张的拉来练习舌头，拉，拉，拉，拉，拉，拉，拉，拉。很漂亮。你们在这方面真的很棒。然后，发出一个R的声音。嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯。这就像是给舌头喝香槟。最后，如果我只能做一个，专家称之为警报。这真的很好。它从“我们”开始，然后到“啊”。 “我们”是高音，而“啊”是低音。所以你去，我们啊啊啊啊啊。

[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=535.8610940400544)
Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you.
Next time you speak, do those in advance.
太棒了。给自己一个掌声。请坐，谢谢。下次你讲话时，提前做这些练习。

[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI#t=543.1211739942779)
Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading.
现在让我来把这个话题放到更广阔的背景下来结束。这是一个严肃的观点。这就是我们现在所处的地方，对吧？我们跟那些根本不在意的人说话时表现得不是很好，而这些人处在一个全是噪音和糟糕音响环境中。我在这个舞台上的不同阶段已经谈到了这一点。如果我们能够向那些有意识倾听的人以及适合目的的环境中大声说话，世界会是什么样子？或者更广泛地说，如果我们能够有意识地创造声音、有意识地消费声音，并且有意识地为声音设计我们的所有环境，那么世界会是什么样子？那将是一个听起来美妙的世界，一个理解成为常态的世界，而这是一个值得传播的想法。


Thank you.
谢谢。
