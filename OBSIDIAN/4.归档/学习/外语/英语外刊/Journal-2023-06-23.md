# Fossil fuel loss wouldn't impoverish public, study shows

## 文章背景

研究表明，为避免灾难性的气候变化而迅速减少化石燃料的使用，对大多数人的财务影响极小。研究发现，在高收入国家，最富有的 10% 人口会承担大部分的财务损失，而对中低收入群体的影响则微乎其微，且政府可以轻易地对这些影响进行补偿。对美国，英国和欧洲大陆的研究结果也一致。总的来说，这项研究反驳了那些认为削减化石燃料会对公众经济产生重大影响的反对气候行动的观点。

## 正文

【Para.1】A rapid reduction in fossil fuels, essential to avoid ==devastating== climate breakdown, would have minimal financial impact on the vast majority of people, new research has shown.

- devastating adj.毁灭性的；令人难受的；令人印象深刻的；压倒性的

【Para.2】Urgently cutting back on fossil fuel production is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown and the economic and social ==turmoil== that would ==ensue==. However, some opponents of climate action claim it is too expensive. They argue that rapidly scaling back fossil fuel production would leave billions of pounds of “==stranded== assets”, leading to an economic slump that would impoverish the public through a fall in the value of savings and pension funds. Research published on Thursday finds that the loss of fossil fuel assets would have a minimal impact on the general public.

- turmoil n.混乱；骚动；动乱；焦虑
- ensue v.接着发生；因而产生
- stranded adj.残留在垒上的

【Para.3】**“We find that the bulk of financial losses associated with rotten, polluting assets is borne by the wealthy,”** said the co-author Lucas Chancel, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris. “Only a small share of financial losses is borne by the working and middle class because they have no or relatively little financial wealth.”

【Para.4】The study, published in the journal Joule, found that in high-income countries two-thirds of the financial losses would be borne by the most affluent 10%. In contrast, governments could easily compensate for the minimal impact on those on middle and lower levels of wealth.

【Para.5】Chancel said: “These latter groups have nothing to fear from rapid action, in particular if governments decide to compensate for their losses, which can be done at relatively low cost.” The study found that in the US, two-thirds of the financial losses from lost fossil fuel assets would affect the top 10% of wealth holders, with half of that affecting the top 1%.

【Para.6】Because the wealthiest people tend to have a ==“diverse portfolio of investments”==, it found, any losses would still make up less than 1% of this group’s net wealth. Just 3.5% of financial losses from stranded assets would affect the poorest half of Americans and could easily be compensated for by government.

【Para.7】When the researchers repeated this analysis for the UK and ==continental== European countries, they found similar results. “There’s this idea that it’s the general ==populace== that should be opposed to climate policy that creates stranded assets because their pensions are at risk or their retirement savings or just their savings,” said the co-author Gregor Semieniuk, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “It’s not untrue that some wealth is at risk, but in affluent countries, it’s not a reason for government inaction because it would be so cheap for governments to compensate that.”
