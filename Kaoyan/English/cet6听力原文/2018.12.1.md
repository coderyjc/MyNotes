M: Hey, I just read a great book about physics. I think you’d like it. It’s called the Physics of the World. It’s written by a scientist named Sylvia Mendez.

W: Oh, I read that book. [1] It was great. The writer was a warm and competent guide to the mysteries of physics. I think it promises enrichment for any reader from those who know little about science to the career physicist.

M: And it’s refreshing to see a strong curious clever woman adding her voice to the scientific discourse and a field that has been traditionally dominated by men. [2]I think she has to be commended for making an effort to include anecdotes about little known female scientists. You know they were often victims of a generation firmly convinced that the woman’s place was in the home.

 W: [3] I like how the book is clearly written with each chapter brought to life by pieces of fascinating knowledge. For example in one chapter she exposes a myth that I’ve heard taught by university physics professors. I’ve often heard that medieval glass windows are thicker at the bottom because glass flows like a fluid. This, she shows, is not true. The distortion is actually thanks to a peculiarity of the glassmakers’ process.

M: [4] Yeah, I like how she cultivates scientific engagement by providing a host of Do It Yourself experiments that bring the same foundational principles of classical physics that govern everything from the solar system to your kitchen table. From using complex laws of physics to test whether a spinning egg is cooked to measuring atmospheric pressure by lifting a piece of cardboard. Her hands-on examples make her book a truly interactive read.

W: Yes, I must say this a equation-free book is an ideal read for scientists of all stripes, anyone teaching science and even people who dislike physics.



Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

1. What does the woman say about the book the man recommended?

2. What can we find in the book the man recommended?

3. How does the author bring her book to life?

4. How does the book cultivate readers interest in physics?





男：嘿，我刚读了一本关于物理学的好书。我想你会喜欢它。书的名称是《世界的物理学》，是由一位名叫希尔维亚·门德兹的科学家写的。

女：哦，我看过那本书。写得非常棒。作者的亲切和过人能力指引我们走向物理学的奇妙之处。我觉得这本书丰富了那些对物理学知之甚少的读者甚至物理学家的认知。

男：在这个传统上由男性主宰的领域，能看到一个强大、求知欲强的聪明女性在科学领域中发声，着实令人耳目一新。我认为，她将鲜为人知的女科学家的轶事列为其中努力是值得赞扬的。你知道她们往往是一个时代的受害者，人们坚信女性的位置是在家里。

女：我喜欢这本书脉络清晰，每一章都通过一些引人入胜的知识而被鲜活生动地呈现出来。例如，在一章中，她揭示了一个我曾听大学物理学教授讲过的并未得到证实的观点。我经常听说中世纪的玻璃窗底部都较厚，因为玻璃像液体一样流动。她表示，这不是真的。变形其实应归功于玻璃制造商的工艺流程的特性。

男：是的，我喜欢她通过提供一系列自己动手的实验来建立科学的参与方式。这些实验带来了与经典物理学相同的基本原理。大到太阳系，小到家里，都受同样的物理法则支配。从使用复杂的物理定律，通过抬起一块纸板来测量大气压力，测试旋转的鸡蛋是否煮熟。她亲身实践的例子使得她的书成为了真正的互动式阅读。

女：是的，我必须说，这本没有一个方程式的书是各类科学家、任何教授科学的人以及甚至不喜欢物理的人的理想读物。

M: Hi professor. I was hoping I could have a moment of your time if you’re not too busy. [5] I’m having some problems getting started on my dissertation and I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to begin.

W: Sure. I have quite a few students though. So can you remind me what your topic is?

M: [6] The general topic I chose is aesthetics, but that’s as far as I’ve got, I don’t really know where to go from there.

W: [6] Yeah, that’s much too large a topic. You really need to narrow it down in order to make it more accessible. Otherwise you’ll be writing a book.

M: Exactly. That’s what I wanted to ask you about. [7] I was hoping it would be possible for me to change topics. I’m really more interested in nature than beauty.

W: [8] I’m afraid you have to adhere to the assigned topic. Still, If you’re interested in nature, then that certainly can be worked into your dissertation. We’ve talked about Hume before in class right.

M: Oh yeah, he’s the philosopher who wrote about where our ideas of beauty come from.

W: Exactly. I suggest you go to the library and get a copy of his biography. Start from there. But remember to stick to the parameters of the assignment. This paper is a large part of your cumulative grade. So make sure to follow the instructions. If you take a look at his biography, you can get a good idea of how his life experiences manifest themselves in his theories of beauty. Specifically the way he looked towards nature as the origin of what we find beautiful.

M: Great. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions, professor. I’ll let you get back to class now.

W: If there’s anything else you need, please come see me in my office any time.

男：教授，您好。如果您不是太忙，我想占用您一点时间。在着手写论文时，我遇到一些问题，希望您能就如何开始给我一些建议。

女：当然。但我的学生比较多，所以你能提醒一下我，你的论文主题是什么吗？

男：我选的大主题是美学，但就我而言，我真的不知道如何着手。

女：是的，该主题太大了。你确实需要将范围缩小，使其更容易开始，不然你要写一本书。

男：确实如此，这就是我想咨询您的地方。我希望我可以改一下主题。我对大自然比对美更感兴趣一些。

女：恐怕你得遵循指定的主题。尽管如此，如果你对大自然感兴趣，当然可以将其融入你的论文之中。我们在课前谈论过休谟。

男：哦，是的。他就是那位写了我们有关美的想法来自于何处的哲学家。

女：正是。我建议你去图书馆找一本他的传记，以此作为开端，但谨记作业的标准。该论文会占你累积成绩的很大一部分。所以要确保遵循指导。如果你读他的传记，你就能很好地理解他的生活经历是如何在他的美学理论中体现出来的，尤其是他将大自然看作是我们寻找美的起源的方式。

男：太好了。谢谢您抽时间回答我的问题，教授。请您现在回教室上课吧。

### Passage 1



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.



9.A) The unprecedented high temperature in Greenland.

B) The collapse of ice on the northern tip of Greenland.

C) The unusual cold spell in the Arctic area in October.

D) The rapid change of Arctic temperature within a day.



10.A) It has created a totally new climate pattern.

B) It will pose a serious threat to many species.

C) It typically appears about once every ten years.

D) It has puzzled the climate scientists for decades.



11.A) Extinction of Arctic wildlife.  C) Emigration of indigenous people.

B) Iceless summers in the Arctic.  D) Better understanding of ecosystems.



During the Arctic winter from October to March, the average temperature in the frozen north typically hovers around minus 20 degrees Celsius. [9] But this year the Arctic is experiencing much higher temperatures. On February the 20th the temperature in Greenland climbed above freezing or zero degrees Celsius and it stayed there for over 24 hours. Then on February the 24th the temperature on Greenland’s northern tip reached six degrees Celsius. Climate scientists describe the phenomenon as stunning. Weather conditions that drive this bizarre temperature surge have visited the Arctic before. [10] They typically appear about once in a decade. However the last such increase in temperature took place two years ago. This is troubling as climbing arctic temperatures combined with rapid sea ice loss are creating a new type of climate feedback loop which could accelerate Arctic warming. Indeed,sea ice cover in the Arctic is melting faster than expected. Without those masses of cooling sea ice, warm air brought to the Arctic can penetrate further inland than it ever did before. The air can stay warmer longer too. This drives additional melting. Overall, earth is warming at a rapid pace. 2014 through 2017 rank as the hottest years on record and the Arctic is warming twice as fast as any place else on earth. This raises unique challenges for Arctic wildlife and indigenous people who depend on Arctic ecosystems to survive. Previously climate forecasts predicted that Arctic summer ice would disappear entirely by around 2060, [11] but based on what scientists are seeing now, the Arctic may be facing summers without ice within 20 years.



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.

9. What did climate scientists describe as stunning?

10. What does the passage say about that temperature surge in the Arctic?

11. What may occur in 20 years according to scientists’ recent observations?





在10月到次年3月北极的冬季，北部平均温度极低，通常在零下20摄氏度左右。但今年北极正在经历更高的气温。2月20日，格陵兰岛的气温升至冰点或零摄氏度以上，并且持续时间超过24小时。然后，2月24日，格陵兰岛北端的温度达到了6摄氏度。气候学家称这种现象令人震惊。推动这种奇异的温度升高的气候条件之前也曾在北极出现过。此条件通常十年内出现一次。然而，上一次发生这样的温度升高是在两年前。随着不断攀升的北极气温，加上快速的海冰损失正在形成一种新型的气候反馈回路，能加速北极变暖，这颇令人不安。事实上，北极覆盖的海冰融化速度比预期的要快。没有那些大量冷却的海冰，带到北极的暖空气将比以前更深入地进入内陆。空气也可以更长时间地保持更加温暖。这会带来额外的融化。整个地球正在快速变暖。2014年至2017年是有记录以来最热的年份，北极变暖的速度是地球上任何其他地方的两倍。这给依赖北极生态系统生存的北极野生生物和土著人民带来了独特的挑战。先前的气候预报预测说，到2060年左右，北极夏季冰将完全消失，但基于科学家现在看到的情况，北极可能在20年内就将面临没有冰的夏季。



9.气候学家认为什么令人震惊？

A)格陵兰岛前所未有的高温。

B)格陵兰岛北端的冰崩。

C)10月北极地区不寻常的寒流。

D)一天之内北极温度的快速变化。



10.本文如何评价北极温度激增？

A)它创造了一种全新的气候模式。

B)它将对许多物种构成严重威胁。

C)它通常十年出现一次。

D)数十年来，它一直困扰着气候科学家。



11.根据科学家最近的观察，20年后可能会发生什么？

A)北极野生动物的灭绝。

B)北极无冰的夏日。

C) 土著人民移民。

D)更好地了解生态系统。

### Passage 2





Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.



12.A) A good start.  C) A strong determination.

B) A detailed plan.  D) A scientific approach.



13.A) Most people get energized after a sufficient rest.

B) Most people tend to have a finite source of energy.

C) It is vital to take breaks between demanding mental tasks.

D) It is most important to have confidence in one’s willpower.



14.A) They could keep on working longer.

B) They could do more challenging tasks.

C) They found it easier to focus on work at hand.

D) They held more positive attitudes toward life.



15.A) They are part of their nature.  C) They are related to culture.

B) They are subject to change.  D) They are beyond control.







[12] A good dose of willpower is often necessary to see any task through whether it’s sticking to a spending plan or finishing a great novel. [13] And if you want to increase that willpower, a new study suggests you just simply have to believe you have it. According to this study, what matters most is what we think about our willpower. If we believe it’s a finite resource, we act that way, we feel exhausted and need breaks between demanding mental tasks. However, people who view their willpower as a limitless resource get energized instead. The researchers used a psychological assessment tool to test the validity of the study. They asked 1, 100 Americans and 1, 600 Europeans to grade different statements such as after a challenging mental activity, my energy is depleted and I must rest to get it refueled again or I can focus on a mental task for long periods without feeling tired.

[14] Although there was little difference between men and women overall, Americans were more likely to admit to needing breaks after completing mentally challenging tasks. European participants on the other hand claimed they were able to keep going. Based on the findings, the researchers suggest that the key to boosting your willpower is to believe that you have an abundant supply of it. [15] Your feelings about your willpower affect the way you behave. But these feelings are changeable, they said. Changing your beliefs about the nature of your self-control can have positive effects on character development. This leads to healthier behaviors and perceptions of other people.



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.

12. What is often necessary for carrying through a task?

13. What is the finding of the new study?

14. What do we learn about European participants as compared with their American counterparts?

15. What do the research say concerning people’s feelings about willpower?





我们往往需要很强的意志力才能做完一项任务，无论这项任务是坚持预算还是完成一部伟大的小说。如果你想要增强意志力，一项新的研究建议说，你只需要单纯地相信你拥有意志力就行。根据该研究，最重要的是我们对意志力的看法。如果我们认为它是有限的资源，我们那样行事，我们会觉得精疲力尽，在高要求的脑力劳动之间需要休息。然而，那些将他们的意志力视为无穷无尽的资源的人，反而变得精力充沛。研究人员使用心理评估工具来检验该研究的有效性。他们要求1100名美国人和1600名欧洲人对不同的陈述进行评分，例如，在一项富有挑战性的智力活动之后，我的能量已经耗尽，我必须休息再次加油，或者我能长时间集中于某智力活动，而不感觉疲劳。

虽然男女之间几乎没有什么差别，但美国人更有可能承认在完成智力上具有挑战性的任务之后需要休息，而另一方面，欧洲的参与者则声称他们能继续。根据其结果，研究人员认为，提高意志力的关键是相信你有充足的供应。你对意志力的感受会影响你的行为方式。但他们说感受是会变化的。改变你对自我控制本质的看法能对性格发展产生积极影响。这会带来更健康的行为方式，以及对他人的看法。



12.完成一项任务通常需要什么？

A)良好的开端。

B)详细计划。

C)坚定的决心。

D)科学方法。



13.新研究的发现是什么？

A)大多数人在充分休息后都会恢复精力。

B)大多数人往往拥有有限的能量来源。

C)在高要求的脑力劳动之间，休息至关重要。

D)对一个人的意志力充满信心是最重要的。



14.与美国同行相比，我们对欧洲参与者了解到了什么？

A)他们可以继续工作更长时间。

B)他们可以完成更具挑战性的任务。

C)他们发现更容易专注于手头上的工作。

D)他们对生活的态度更加积极。



15.如何看待人们对意志力的感受？

A)它们是天性的一部分。

B)它们可能会发生变化。

C)它们与文化有关。

D)它们无法控制。

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16.A) About half of current jobs might be automated.

B) The jobs of doctors and lawyers would be threatened.

C) The job market is becoming somewhat unpredictable.

D) Machine learning would prove disruptive by 2013.



17.A) They are widely applicable for massive poen online courses.

B) They are now being used by numerous high school teachers.

C) They could read as many as 10, 000 essays in a single minute.

D) They could grade high-school essays just like human teachers.



18.A) It needs instructions throughout the process.

B) It does poorly on frequent, high-volume tasks.

C) It has to rely on huge amounts of previous data.

D) It is slow when it comes to tracking novel things.





Here is my baby niece Sarah. Her mum is a doctor and her dad is a lawyer. By the time Sarah goes to college the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different. In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work. [16] They concluded that almost one in every two jobs has a high risk of being automated by machines. Machine learning is the technology that’s responsible for most of this disruption. It’s the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. It allows machines to learn from data and copy some of the things that humans can do. My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning. We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia. This gives us an unique perspective on what machines can do, what they can’t do and what jobs they might automate or threaten. Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early 90s. It started with relatively simple tasks. It started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading handwritten zip codes. Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs. Machine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks. [17] In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build a program that could grade high school essays. The winning programs were able to match the grades given by human teachers. Now given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this. A teacher might read 10, 000 essays over a 40-year career. A machine can read millions of essays within minutes. We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent high-volume tasks, but there are things we can do that machines cannot. Where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations. Machines can’t handle things they haven’t seen many times before. [18] The fundamental limitation of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data. But humans don’t. We have the ability to connect seemingly different threads to solve problems we’ve never seen before.



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.

16. What did the researchers at Oxford University conclude?

17. What do we learn about Kaggle companies winning programs?

18. What is the fundamental limitation on machine learning?





这是我的小侄女莎拉。她的妈妈是一名医生，爸爸是一名律师。当莎拉上大学时，她父母所做的工作会有很大的不同。2013年，牛津大学的研究人员对未来的工作进行了研究。他们的结论是，几乎每两个工作中就有一个工作被机器自动化取代的风险很高。机器学习是这项技术的主要原因，它是人工智能中最强大的分支。它让机器能够从数据中学习，并模仿人类可以做的一些事情。我的公司Kaggle对机器学习的最前沿技术发挥着作用。我们聚集了数十万专家，为工业界和学术界解决重大问题。这为我们提供了一个独特的视角，让我们了解机器可以做什么，不能做什么，以及哪些工作能被自动化或受到威胁。机器学习在90年代初开始进入工业领域。开始时做相对简单的任务，从评估贷款申请的信用风险、通过阅读手写的邮政编码对邮件进行分类等这类事情开始。在过去的几年里，我们取得了重大突破。如今，机器学习能够完成更为复杂的任务。2012年，Kaggle向其团体提出一项挑战，即建立一个可以给高中生短文评分的程序。获胜的程序能够与人类教师给出的成绩相匹配。现在，根据正确的数据，机器将在这类任务上胜过人类。在40年的职业生涯中，一位老师可能会阅读10000篇短文。一台机器可以在几分钟内就阅读数百万篇短文。在频繁的大批量任务中，我们没有同机器竞争的机会，但我们可以做一些机器不能做的事情。在处理新情况方面，机器取得的进展很小。机器无法处理之前没有见过的事情。机器学习的基本限制是，它需要从大量过去的数据中进行学习。但人类不用，我们拥有连接似乎看起来颇为不同的线索的能力，解决我们之前从未曾遇到的问题。



16.牛津大学的研究人员得出的结论是什么？

A)目前约有一半的工作可能会自动化操作。

B)医生和律师的工作将受到威胁。

C)就业市场变得有些不可预测。

D)到2013年，机器学习将具有破坏性。



17.我们对Kaggle公司获胜的程序有哪些了解？

A)它们广泛适用于大规模开放式在线课程。

B)它们现在被许多高中教师使用。

C)它们可以在一分钟内阅读多达10000篇短文。

D)它们可以像人类老师一样对高中生的短文进行评分。



18.机器学习的基本限制是什么？

A)整个过程都需要指示。

### Recording 2



Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.

19.A) The engineering problems with solar power.

B) The generation of steam with the latest technology.

C) The importance of exploring new energy sources.

D) The theoretical aspects of sustainable energy.



20.A) Drive trains with solar energy.

B) Upgrade the city’s train facilities.

C) Build a new ten-kilometre railway line.

D) Cut down the city’s energy consumption.



21.A) Build a tank for keeping calcium oxide.

B) Find a new material for storing energy.

C) Recover super-heated steam.

D) Collect carbon dioxide gas.





[19] We’ve talked recently about the importance of sustainable energy. We’ve also talked about the different theories on how that can be done. So far, our discussions have all been theoretical. Now I have a practical question for you all. Can you run a 140, 000 kilogram train on just the steam generated by solar power? Well, one engineer, Tim Casselman, believes it’s possible. And his home city of Sacramento, California should see the technology’s first test.As part of the upgrading of its rail yard, [20] Casselman, who is an inventor and self-proclaimed steam visionary, is campaigning for a new steam train that runs without any fire and could run on an existing 10 kilometers line drawing tourists and perhaps offering city commuters a green alternative to their cars. Casselman wants to build an array of solar magnifying mirrors at one end of the line to collect and focus heat onto water filled tubes. This would generate steam that could be used to fill tanks on a small steam train without the use of fire.Supplying power to trains in this way would offer the shortest distance from well to wheels he says with the least amount of energy lost. According to Harry Valentijn, a Canadian engineer who is researching modern steam technology, a special tank measuring 2 by 10 metres could store over 750 kilowatt hours of energy as high pressure steam enough to pull a two-car train for an hour or so. Energy to drive a steam locomotive can be stored in other materials besides water. [21] For example, a team at Tohoku University in Japan has studied materials that can store large amounts of heat. When heated, these materials turn from a solid into a liquid absorbing energy as they change phase. The liquid is maintained above its melting point until steam is required at which point the liquid is allowed to turn back into a solid releasing its stored energy. Another team at Nagoya University in Japan has tested calcium compound as an energy storage material. Heating this chemical compound drives off carbon dioxide gas, leaving calcium oxide. The gas can be stored under pressure in a tank. To recover the energy the gas is fed back over the calcium oxide. In theory, says Valentijn, this can create a high enough temperature to generate superheated steam.

我们最近谈到了可持续能源的重要性，还谈论了如何做到这一点的不同理论。到目前为止，我们所有的讨论都是理论层面的。现在，我想问你们所有人一个实际的问题。你们能用太阳能产生的蒸汽来运行一辆140000公斤重的火车吗？好吧，一位名叫蒂姆·卡塞尔曼的工程师认为这是可能的。在他的家乡加利福尼亚州萨克拉门托市应该能看到该技术进行的第一次测试。作为其铁路段升级的一部分，卡塞 尔曼，一位发明家，也自称为蒸汽梦想家，正在为一辆新的，不用任何火力驱动的蒸汽火车做推广，这辆火车可在现有的10公里长的线上运载游客，或许还可以为城市通勤族提供替代私家车的绿色出行方案。卡塞尔曼希望在铁路线的一端建造一系列太阳能放大镜，从而收集热量，并将热量聚集到注满水的管子上。这会产生蒸汽，可用在不使用火力的小型蒸汽火车上用以填充罐子。他说，以这种方式向列车供电是从源头到车轮的最短距离，能量损失最少。据正在研究现代蒸汽技术的加拿大工程师哈利·瓦伦坦泰因的观点，一个2×10米的特殊油箱可以存储超过750千瓦时的能量作为高压蒸汽，足以拉动一列两节车厢的火车一小时左右。除了水外，驱动蒸汽机车的能量可以存储在其他物质中。例如，日本东北大学的团队正在研究可以储存大量热能的材料。在被加热时，这些材料会从固态转为液态，在其改变状态时，吸收能量。让液体保持在其熔点之上，直至需要蒸汽时，才让液体变回固体，释放其储存的能量。日本名古屋大学的另一个团队测试了将钙化合物作为一种储存能量的材料。加热这种化合物会释放二氧化碳气体，留下氧化钙。在压力下，气体可以存储在罐子中。为了回收能量，让气体回到氧化钙中。根据瓦伦坦泰因的理论，这能造成足够高的温度，从而产生过热蒸汽。

25.A) They are unable to pay for health services.

B) They have long been discriminated against.

C) They are vulnerable to illnesses and diseases.

D) They have contributed a great deal to society.







Today’s crisis in care for older people in England has two main causes.

First, people are living longer with a lot more complex needs. [22] Second, they rely on a system that has long been marked by a poor relation between national health and social-care services.

Current services originate in two key measures. They are the National Health Service and the 1948 National Assistance Act. This required local government to provide residential accommodation for older people and supervise care homes run by independent organizations.

They also provided home and community services including meals, day centers and home helpers and other subsidized services. The National Health Service was free and wholly publicly provided. It delivered the best health-care for all. No such vision guided residential and community care though. [23] The care was substantially provided by voluntary services which worked together with local authorities as they long had with eligibility based on income. Today, life expectancy has risen from 66 for a male at birth in 1948 to around 80 now. In addition, there is better overall health and improved medical knowledge in care. This means an unprecedented number of people are surviving longer in conditions requiring expert support.      Families provide at least as much care as they ever did. Even so, they can rarely without subsidised support address serious personal needs. Care for older people faced persistent criticism as these trends became apparent. From the early 1960s, local authorities were required to plan health and welfare services. The aim was to en-able older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, but this increased concern about the lack of coordination between free health and paid-for social care. Through the 1970s, a number of measures sought to improve matters. However at a time of financial crisis, funding diminished and little changed. [24] In the 1980s, the government cut spending. Meanwhile, preference for private over public services made management even more difficult.Simultaneously, the number of sick older people grew. Governments emphasized the need to improve services. They did so though while doing little to stop the erosion of available aid. Services were irregular across authorities. Unless you were prepared to pay, they were increasingly difficult to obtain for any but the most severely disabled. Why has 60 years of criticism produced so little change? [25] Discrimination against older people has a long history. Additionally, those affected by inadequate health and social care are too vulnerable to launch the protests that have addressed other forms of discrimination.

 如今，在英国，老年人护理危机有两大主要原因。

第一，人们活得更久，需求更为复杂。第二，他们依赖的体系，长期以来被评价为国民医疗服务制度和社会保健服务之间的关系很糟糕。

当前服务起源于两大关键措施——国家医疗服务体系和1948年国家扶助法。这要求当地政府为老年人提供住宿，并监督由独立组织运营的养老院。

它们还提供家庭和社区服务，包括膳食，日间照管中心和家庭佣工以及其他补贴服务。国家医疗服务体系全部公开且免费。这为所有人提供了最好的保健服务。然而，没有这样的眼光格局来指导住宅和社区护理。基于具有收入的资格，该护理主要由与地方当局长期合作的志愿服务提供。如今，人们的寿命从1948年出生时男性66岁延长至现在的80岁左右。此外，人们的整体健康状况更好，医疗知识和护理也得到改进。这意味着，在专业支持的情况下，活得更久的人数将达到史无前例的数量。家庭至少提供与以往一样多的照料。即便如此，他们很少能在没有补贴支持的情况下解决严重的个人需求。随着这些趋势变得越来越明显，对老年人的照顾面临持续的批评。从20世纪60年代初开始，地方当局被要求规划健康和福利服务。其目的是让老年人尽可能久地留在他们自己的家中，但人们对免费健康与付费社会护理之间缺乏协调的 问题越来越关注。20世纪70年代间，陆续出台了一些措施力图改善这一问题。然而，在金融危机时期，供养资金减少，几乎没有改变。在20世纪80年代，政府削减开支。与此同时，人们对私人公共服务的偏好使管理变得愈加困难。同时，患病的老年人的人数也在增加。各国政府都强调需要改善服务。虽然他们也这样做了，然而，却没有做什么来阻止对可用帮助的削弱。各地的服务很不规范。除非你准备好付钱了，否则，除了最严重的残疾人之外，其他人越来越难以获得服务。为何60年来的批评产生的改变如此之小呢？长久以来一直对老年人存在歧视。此外，受健康和社会护理不足影响的人太脆弱了，没法发起抗议活动，而这些抗议活动已经解决了其他类型的歧视。
