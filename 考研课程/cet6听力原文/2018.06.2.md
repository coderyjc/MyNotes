M: Tonight we have a special guest from a local establishment，the Parisian Café, Welcome!

W: Hi，thanks for having me on your show.

M: Thank you for joining us. So please tell us, why did you decide to open a café?【Q1】

W: Well, we saw the opportunity to offer something a little special and different from other establishments. Cafés certainly are a very competitive market sector. There are more than plenty in our city, and we felt they are all rather similar to each other.【Q2】 Wouldn’t you agree?

M: Certainly yes. So how is your establishment any different?

W: Well，simply put，we have rabbits wandering freely around the place. Our customers come in and enjoy their food and drinks while little

rabbits play about and brush against their legs. There is no other place like it.

M: That’s amazing! How did you come up with the idea?

W: We saw other cafés with cats in them. So we thought，why not rabbits? People love rabbits. They are very cute animals.

M: But is it safe? Do the rabbits ever bite people? Or do any customers ever hurt the rabbits?

W: It’s perfectly safe for both rabbits and our customers. Rabbits are very peaceful and certainly do not bite. Furthermore, our rabbits are regularly cleaned and have all received the required shots. So there is no health risk whatsoever.【Q3】 As for our customers, they are all animal lovers, so they would never try to hurt the rabbits.【Q4】 Sometimes a young child may get over-excited, and they are a little too rough, but it’s never a serious matter. On the contrary，the Parisian Café offers a great experience for children，a chance for them to learn about rabbits and how to take care of them.

M: Well，it’s certainly the first time I’ve heard of a café like that.





男：今晚我们请来了一位来自当地企业巴黎咖啡馆的特邀嘉宾。欢迎你的到来！

女：你好，谢谢您邀请我上您的节目。

男：谢谢您加入我们。请告诉我们，为何您选择开设一家咖啡馆呢？

女：好的，我们看到能提供与其他企业有点特殊和不同东西的机会。咖啡馆当然是一个竞争非常激烈的市场领域。我们城市里有非常多的咖啡馆，而且我们觉得它们都非常相似。您同意这点吗？

男：当然同意了。那么您的企业有如何不同呢？

女：好吧，简单地说，我们有兔子在这里自由地游荡。我们的顾客进来享受他们的食物和饮料，而与此同时，小兔子与他们玩耍，从他们腿边擦身而过。没有其它地方和这里一样。

男：太棒了！您是如何想出这一主意的呢？

女：我们看到其它咖啡馆里面有猫。于是我们想，为何不是兔子呢？人们喜爱兔子。它们是非常可爱的动物。

男：但是这安全吗？兔子曾咬过人吗？或者曾有顾客伤害过兔子吗？

女：这对兔子和我们的顾客都是完全安全的。兔子非常温和，当然不会咬人。此外，我们会定期清洁兔子，它们全部接种了所要求的疫苗。因此，没有任何健康风险。至于我们的顾客，他们都是动物爱好者，所以他们绝不会试图伤害兔子。有时，年幼的小孩可能会过度兴奋，而且他们会有点过于粗暴，但这绝不是严重的问题。相反，Parisian咖啡馆为孩子们提供了很好的体验，让他们有机会了解兔子以及如何照顾它们。

男：好吧，这绝对是我第一次听说这样一种咖啡馆。

M: Hey，there. How are you?

W: Oh，hi. I’m great! Thanks. And you took great, too.

M: Thank you. It’s good to see you shopping at the organic section. I see you’ve got lots of healthy stuff. I wish I could buy more organic produce from here, but I find the kids don’t like it. I don’t know about yours, but mine are all about junk food.【Q5】

W: Oh，trust me! I know exactly how you fell. My children are the same.What is it with kids these days and all that junk food they eat? I think it’s all that advertising on TV. That’s where they get it.【Q6】

M: Yes, it must be. My children see something on TV and they immediately want it. It’s like they don’t realize it’s just an advertisement.

W: Right. And practically everything that’s advertised for children is unhealthy processed foods. No surprise then it becomes a battle for us parents to feed our children ordinary fruit and vegetables.

M: That’s just the thing. One never sees ordinary ingredients being advertised on TV. It’s never a carrot or a peach. It’s always some garbage，like chocolate-covered sweets. So unhealthy.

W: Exactly. And these big food corporations have so much money to spend on celever tactics designed to make young children want to buy their products.【Q7】 Children never stand a chance. It’s really not fair.

M: You are so right. When we were children，we barely had any junk food available,【Q8】and we turned out just fine.

W: Yes. My parents don’t understand any of it. Both the TV commercials and the supermarkets are alien to them. Their world was so different back when they were young.

M: I don’t know what will happen to the next generation.

W: The world is going crazy.

M: You bet.





男：嘿，你好吗？

女：哦，嗨，我很好!谢谢。你看起来也很不错。

男：谢谢。很高兴看见你在有机区购物。我看到你已经买了很多健康的东西。我希望我能从这里买更多的有机产品，但我发现孩子们不喜欢。我不知道你的孩子怎样，但是我的就喜欢垃圾食品。

女：哦，相信我！我完全明白你的感受。我的孩子们也一样。现如今的孩子们都怎么了，以及他们吃的所有那些垃圾食品？我认为全是电视上的那些广告。他们从这些广告中知道的。

男：是的，肯定是这样。我的孩子们在电视上看见某物，他们立马就想要买。似乎他们意识不到这仅仅只是广告。

女：是的。几乎所有面向儿童的广告都是不健康的加工食品。不足为奇，这与父母想用普通水果和蔬菜喂养孩子相冲突。

男：是的。我们从没看见普通食材在电视上做广告。不会给胡萝卜或桃子做广告。从来都是给巧克力糖一类的垃圾食品做广告。太不健康了。

女：正是如此。而且这些大型食品公司有很多钱花在高明的把戏上，旨在让孩子们想要购买他们的产品。孩子们永远没有抵挡的机会。这真的很不公平。

男：你说得很对。当我们还是孩子的时候，我们几乎没有任何垃圾食品，而且我们最后都还不错。

女：是的。我的父母从来都不明白这些。电视广告和超市对他们来说都是陌生的。在他们年轻的时候，世界还是如此的不同。

男：我不知道下一代会发生什么。

女：世界变得疯狂。

男：的确如此。

### Passage 1



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.



9.A)Stretches of farmland.

B)Typical Egyptian animal farms.

C)Tombs of ancient rulers.

D)Ruins left by devastation floods.



10.A)It provides habitats for more primitive tribes.

B)It is hardly associated with great civilizations.

C)It has not yet been fully explored and exploited.

D)It gathers water from many tropical rain forests.



11.A)It carries about one fifth of the world’s fresh water.

B)It has numerous human settlements along its banks.

C)It is second only to the Mississippi River in width.

D)It is as long as the Nile and the Yangtze combined.



At some 2,300 miles in length，the Mississippi is the longest river in the United States. At some 1,000 miles, the Mackenzie is the longest river in Canada. But these waterways seem minute in comparison to the world’s two lengthiest rivers—the Nile and the Amazon The Nile，which begins in central Africa and flows over 4,100 miles north into the Mediterranean，hosted one of the world’s great ancient civilizations along its shores, Calm and peaceful for most of the year，the Nile used to flood annually，thereby creating，irrigating and carrying new topsoil to the nearby farmland on which ancient Egypt depended for livelihood. As a means of transportation, the river carried various vessels up and down its length. A journey through the unobstructed part of this waterway today would pass by the splendid Valley of the Kings，where the tombs of many of these ancient monarchs have stood for over 3,000 years.【Q9】

Great civilizations and intensive settlement are hardly associated with the Amazon,【Q10】 yet this 4,000-mile-long South American river carries about 20 percent of the world’s fresh water【Q11】—more than the Mississippi，Nile，and Yangtze combined. Other statistics are equally astonishing. The Amazon is so wide at some points that from its center neither shore can be seen. Each second，the Amazon pours some 55 million gallons of water into the Atlantic; there，at its mouth，stands one island larger than Switzerland Most important of all，the Amazon irrigates the largest tropical rain forest on Earth.





密西西比河长约2300英里，是美国最长的河流。麦肯齐河长约1000英里，是加拿大最长的河流。但与尼罗河和亚马逊河这两条世界上最长的河流相比，这些水道似乎都微不足道。尼罗河始于非洲中部，流经4100英里，向北流入地中海，沿岸孕育了一座世界上最伟大的古代文明。尼罗河一年中的大部分时间都是平静和安宁的，它曾每年都会洪水泛滥，因此，创造、灌溉以及将表土带到附近的农田，这是古埃及人赖以生计的土地。作为一种交通工具，河流承载着各种船只来来回回。今天，沿着这条水道畅通无阻的部分进行的旅程将经过辉煌的帝王谷，这里许多这些古代君主的坟墓已经存在了3000多年。

伟大的文明和密集的定居与亚马逊河几乎无关，然而这条长达4000英里的南美河流承载着世界上20％的淡水，比密西西比河、尼罗河和长江加起来还要多。亚马逊河如此之宽，从其中心点望不到岸边。亚马逊河流每秒都会向大西洋注入大约5500万加仑的水；河口处有一个比瑞士还大的岛屿。最重要的是，亚马逊河灌溉着地球上最大的热带雨林。



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.

9. What can be found in the Valley of the Kings?

10. In what way is the Amazon different from other big rivers?

11. What does the speaker say about the Amazon?



9.在帝王谷能找到什么？

A)农田的延伸。B)典型的埃及动物农场。

C)古代统治者们的坟墓。D)毁灭性洪水留下的废墟。



10.亚马逊河在哪方面与其它大型河流不同？

A)它为更原始的部落提供栖息地。B)它与伟大的文明几乎没有关系。

C)尚未充分探索和开发。D)它从许多热带雨林中采集水。



11.演讲者如何评述亚马逊河？

A)它承载着世界五分之一的淡水。B)沿岸有许多人类住区。

C)它仅次于密西西比河的宽度。D)其长度相当于尼罗河和长江相加的长度。

### Passage 2



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.





12.A)Living a life in the fast lane leads to success.

B)We are always in a rush to do various things.

C)The search for tranquility has become a trend.

D)All of us actually yearn for a slow and calm life.



13.A)She had trouble balancing family and work.

B)She enjoyed the various social events.

C)She was accustomed to tight schedules.

D)She spent all her leisure time writing books.



14.A)The possibility of ruining her family.

D)Reading a book about slowing down.



15.A)She started to follow the cultural norms.

B)She came to enjoy doing everyday tasks.

C)She learned to use more polite expressions.

D)She stopped using to-do lists and calendars.







How often do you say to people “I’m busy” or “I haven’t got time for that.”It’s an inevitable truth that all of us live a life in the fast lane,【Q12】 even though we know that being busy is not always particularly healthy.

Growing up in New Zealand, everything was always calm and slow. People enjoyed the tranquility of a slower pace of life, But after I moved to Tokyo and lived there for a number of years, I got used to having a pile of to-do lists, and my calendar always looked like a mess, with loads of things to do written across it.【Q13】 I found myself filling my time up with endless work meetings and social events，rushing along as busy as bee.

Then, one day, I came across a book called In Praise of Slowness and realized that being busy is not only detrimental, but also has the danger of turning life into an endless race.【Q14】 So I started practicing the various practical steps mentioned by the author in the book, and began to revolt against the very idea of being too busy. It doesn’t mean that my to-do lists no longer exist, but I’ve become more aware of the importance of slowing down and making sure that I enjoy the daily activities as I carry them out.【Q15】

From now no, when someone asks you how your life is，try responding with words like “exciting and fun” instead of the cultural norm that says “busy”. See if you experience the tranquility that follows.





你是否经常对人们说“我很忙”或“我没有时间做这件事”。我们所有人都生活在快车道上，这是不争的事实，尽管我们知道忙碌并不总是特别健康。

我在新西兰长大，一切都平静而缓慢。人们享受着缓慢生活节奏带来的宁静。但在我搬到东京，并在那里生活了好几年之后，我习惯了一堆待办事项清单，而我的时间表总是看起来一团糟，上面还有大量的待办事项。我发现无休止的工作会议和社交活动填满了我的时间，我像蜜蜂一样忙碌着。

然后，有天我偶然看到《享受慢活》这本书，我意识到忙碌不仅有害，而且还有将生命变成没完没了的比赛的危险。于是，我开始练习作者在书中提到的各种实际步骤，并开始反抗过于忙碌的想法。这并不意味着我的待办事项清单不再存在了，但是我越来越意识到放慢速度的重要性，并确保在我实施这些活动时享受日常活动。

从现在开始，当有人问你生活如何的时候，试着用“令人兴奋和有趣”这样的词来回应，而不是那种说“忙”的文化标准。看看你是否能体验到随之而来的宁静。



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.

12.What does the speaker think is an inevitable truth?

13.What does the speaker say about her life in Tokyo?

14.What made the speaker change her lifestyle?

15.What happened after the speaker changed her lifestyle?



12.演讲者认为什么是不争的事实？

A）在快车道生活可以获得成功。

B）我们总是急于做各种事情。

C）寻求宁静已成为一种趋势。

D）我们所有人实际上都渴望缓慢而平静的生活。



13.演讲者如何说她在东京的生活？

A）她曾在平衡家庭和工作方面遇到困难。

B）她喜欢各种社交活动。

C）她习惯于紧张的时间表。

D）她将所有闲暇的时间全部用来写书。



14.什么让演讲者改变了她的生活方式？

A）毁掉她的家庭的可能性。

B）意识到她的健康状况下降。

C）过快节奏生活的疲劳。

D）读一本关于慢生活的书。



15.演讲者在改变了她的生活方式之后，发生了什么？

B）她开始喜欢做日常工作。

C）她学会了使用更礼貌的表达方式。

D）她停止使用待办事项列表和日历。

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.





16.A)They will root out native species altogether.

B)They contribute to a region’s biodiversity.

C)They pose a threat to the local ecosystem.

D)They will crossbreed with native species.



17.A)Their classifications are meaningful.

B)Their interactions are hard to define.

C)Their definitions are changeable.

D)Their distinctions are artificial.



18.A)Only a few of them cause problems to native species.

B)They may turn out to benefit the local environment.

C)Few of them can survive in their new habitats.

D)Only 10 percent of them can be naturalized.





Governments，private groups and individuals spend billions of dollars a year trying to root out nonnative organisms that are considered dangerous to ecosystems, and to prevent the introduction of new intruders. But a number of scientists question the assumption that the presence of alien species can never be acceptable in a natural ecosystem.【Q16】They say that portraying introduced species as inherently bad is an unscientific approach. “Distinctions between exotic and native species are artificial,” said Dr. Michael Rosenzweig,【Q17】 a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona，“because they depend on picking a date and calling the plants and animals that show up after that date ‘exotic’，”Ecosystems free of species defined as exotic are， by default，considered the most natural. “You can’t roll back the clock and remove all exotics or fix habitats，”Dr. Rosenzweig said. “Both native and exotic species can become invasive，and so they all have to be monitored and controlled when they begin to get out of hand.”

At its core，the debate is about how to manage the world’s remaining natural ecosystems and about how，and how much，to restore other habitats. Species that invade a territory can harm ecosystems，agriculture，and human health. They can threaten some native species or even destroy and replace others. Next to habitat loss，these invasive species represent the greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide，many ecologists say. Ecologists generally define an alien species as one that people，accidentally or deliberately，carried to its new location. Across the American continents，exotic species are those introduced after the first European contact. That date，rounded off to 1500 AD，represents what ecologists consider to have been a major shift in the spread of species，including crops and livestock，as they began to migrate with humans from continent to continent.

“Only a small percentage of alien species cause problems in their new habitats,” said Don Smith,【Q18】 professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Tennessee. “Of the 7，000 alien species in the United States—out of a total of 150,000 species—only about 10 percent are invasive，”he pointed out. The other 90 percent have fit into their environments and are considered naturalized. Yet appearances can deceive，ecologists caution，and many of these exotics may be considered acceptable only because no one has documented their harmful effects. What is more，non-native species can appear harmless for decades，then turn invasive.











政府、私人团体和个人每年花费数十亿美元试图根除被认为对生态系统有害的非本土生物，并防止引入新的入侵者。但是，一些科学家质疑这样一种假设，即，外来物种的存在永远不可能被自然生态系统所接受。他们说，将引进的物种描述为从本质上而言是不好的，这是一种不科学的方法。“外来和本土物种之间的区别是人为的。”亚利桑那大学进化生物学教授迈克尔·罗森茨威格博士说：“因为他们依赖于选择一个日期，并将那个日期之后出现的植物和动物称为‘外来的’。”默认情况下，没有被定义为外来物种的生态系统被认为是最自然的。“你无法让时间回调，并移除所有外来物种或修复栖息地。”罗森茨威格博士说：“本土和外来物种都可以成为入侵物种，所以当它们开始失控时，它们都必须受到监控和控制。”

辩论的核心是如何管理世界上遗留的自然生态系统，以及如何并在多大程度上恢复其他栖息地。侵入领土的物种会危害生态系统、农业和人类健康。它们可能会对一些本地物种造成威胁，甚至可以摧毁和替代其他物种。许多生态学家说，除了栖息地丧失之外，这些入侵物种对全世界的生物多样性构成了最大的威胁。生态学家通常将外来物种定义为人们无意或有意地带到新地方的物种。在美洲各大陆，外来物种是在第一次与欧洲接触后引入的物种。可追溯至公元1500年，该日期代表了生态学家所认为的物种传播的重大转变，包括农作物和牲畜，因为它们开始同人类一起，从一大陆迁徙到另一大陆。

田纳西大学生态与进化生物学教授唐·史密斯说：“只有一小部分外来物种会在新的栖息地造成问题。”他指出：“在美国15万物种中，有7000外来物种，它们中只有约10％是侵入性物种。”其它90%的物种融入了它们所处的环境，被认为是归化的。生态学家警告说，表面可能具有欺骗性，许多外来物可能被认为是可接受的，因为没有人记录它们的有害影响。此外，非本地物种几十年来可能看起来都是无害的，然后变成侵入性的。

### Recording 2



Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.



19.A)Respect their traditional culture.

B)Attend their business seminars.

C)Research their specific demands.

D)Adopt the right business strategies.



20.A)Showing them your palm.

B)Giving them gifts of great value.

C)Drinking alcohol on certain days of a month.

D)Clicking your fingers loudly in their presence.



21.A)They are very easy to satisfy.

B)They have a strong sense of worth.

C)They tend to be friendly and enthusiastic.

D)They have a break from 2:00 to 5:30 p.m.







Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! And welcome to the third in our series of business seminars in the program—Doing Business Abroad. Today we are going to look at intercultural awareness，that is，the fact that not everyone is British，not everyone speaks English，and not everyone does business in the British way. And why should they? If overseas business people are selling to us，then they will make every effort to speak English and to respect our traditions and methods. It is only polite for us to do the same when we visit them.【Q19】 It is not only polite. It is essential if we want to sell British products overseas.

First，a short quiz. Let’s see how interculturally aware you are.

Question 1: Where must you not drink alcohol on the first and seventh of every month?

Question 2: Where should you never admire your host’s possessions？

Question 3: How should you attract the waiter during a business lunch in Bangkok?

And Question 4: Where should you try to make all your appointments either before 2:00 or after 5:30 p.m.?

OK. Everyone had a chance to make some notes? Right. Here are the answers—although I am sure that the information could equally well apply to countries other than those I have chosen.

So No. 1，you must not drink alcohol on the first and seventh of the month in India.【Q20】 In international hotels you may find it served，but if you are having a meal with an Indian colleague，remember to avoid asking for a beer if your arrival coincides with one of those dates.2.In Arab countries，the politeness and generosity of the people is without parallel. If you admire your colleague’s beautiful golden bowls，you may well find yourself being presented with them as a present. This is not a cheap way to do your shopping，however，as your host will，quite correctly，expect you to respond by presenting him with a gift of equal worth and beauty. In Thailand，clicking the fingers，clapping your hands，or just shouting “Waiter！” will embarrass your hosts，fellow diners，the waiter himself and，most of all，you! Place your palm downward and make an inconspicuous waving gesture，which will produce instant and satisfying results. And finally，in Spain，some businesses maintain the pattern of working until about 2 o’clock and then returning to the office from 5:30 to 8:00，9:00 or 10:00 in the evening.【Q21】





早上好，女士们，先生们！ 欢迎来到我们举办的第三场“海外开展业务”系列商业研讨会。今天我们将着眼于跨文化意识，即，不是所有人都是英国人，不是所有人都说英语，并不是所有人都以英国人的方式开展业务。而且他们为什么要这样呢？如果海外的商人向我们推销，那么他们将竭尽全力讲英语，并尊重我们的传统和方法。当我们拜访他们时，我们同样做才是礼貌的。这不仅仅是礼貌。如果我们想在海外销售英国产品，这一点至关重要。

首先，一个简短的小测验。让我们看看你具有怎样的跨文化意识。

问题1：每月的第一天和第七天你必须在哪里喝酒？

问题2：在何处你永远不应该称赞东道主的财产？

问题3：在曼谷吃商务午餐期间，您应该如何吸引服务员？

问题4：在何处，你应该试图将所有预约放在2:00之前或5:30之后进行？

好了， 每个人都有机会做些笔记吗？是的，以下是答案——虽然我确信这些信息同样适用于我所选择的国家以外的其他国家。

因此，问题1，在印度，你每月的第一天和第七天不能喝酒。你可能会发现在国际酒店会提供，但如果你和一位印度同事一起吃饭，如果你的到来与其中一个日期相符，请记得避免要一杯啤酒。问题2，在阿拉伯国家，人们的礼貌和慷慨是无与伦比的。如果你赞美同事漂亮的金色碗，你很可能会发现它们被当作礼物送给你。这不是一种便宜的购物方式。然而，正如东道主所希望的，你要送给他同等价值和精美的礼物。在泰国，打响指、拍手，或只是喊“服务员！”会让你的东道主、一起用餐的同伴、服务员本人，最重要的是你，都感到难堪！手掌向下放置，做一个不显眼的挥动手势，这将产生即时和令人满意的效果。最后，在西班牙，一些企业会持续工作直到大约2点，然后在下午5:30再上班，上到晚上8：00、9：00或10:00。



Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.

19.What should you do when doing business with foreigners?

20.What must you avoid doing with your Indian colleague?

21.What do we learn about some Spanish business people?



19.与外国人做生意时，我们应怎样做？

A）尊重他们的传统文化。B）参加他们的商业研讨会。

C）研究他们的具体要求。D）采用正确的商业策略。



20.在与印度同事一起时，一定要避免做什么？

A）向他们展示你的手掌。B）送给他们很有价值的礼物

C）在每月的某些天喝酒。D）在他们面前大声打响指。



21.对于一些西班牙商人，我们了解些什么？

A）他们很容易满足。B）他们有强烈的价值感。

C）他们往往友好而热情。D）他们从下午2:00到5:30休息。

Shortly after he took over the Reader’s Digest Association in 1984，George Grune unlocked the company’s boardroom and announced that the room was now open to the employees. It was a symbolic act，indicating that under Grune’s leadership，Reader’s Digest was going to be different. True to his word，Grune has shaken up the culture here.【Q22】

To get an idea of the culture we’re talking about，consider the boardroom Grune opened up. It has artworks that any museum in the world would want to collect，paintings by many world-famous artists like Monet and Picasso. Its headquarters houses some 3,000 works of art. The main building is topped with a Georgian Tower with four sculptures  of the mythical winged horse，the magazine’s corporate logo. It sits on 127 acres of well-trimmed lawns. The editor’s office used to be occupied by founder Dewitt Wallace，who，along with his wife, Lila Acheson Wallace，launched Reader’s Digest in 1922 with condensed articles from other publications. It has become the world’s most widely read magazine，selling 28 million copies each month in 17 languages and 41 different editions. The Wallaces, both children of church ministers，had a clearly defined formula for their “little magazine” ad Reader’s Digest was originally subtitled. Articles were to be short，readable and uplifting.【Q23】 Subjects were picked to inspire or entertain. The Wallace didn’t accept advertising in the US edition until 1955 and even then they didn’t allow any ads for cigarettes，liquor or drugs. The Wallaces also had a clear sense of the kind of workplace they wanted. It started as a mom-and-pop operation，and the childless Wallaces always considered employees to be part of their family.【Q24】 Employees still tell stories of how the Wallaces would take care of their employees who had met with misfortunes and they showered their employees with unusual benefits，like a turkey at Thanksgiving and Fridays off in May. This cozy workplace no longer exists here. The Wallaces both died in their nineties in the early 1980s. George Grune, a former ad salesman who joined Reader’s Digest in 1960 has his eye focused on the bottom line. In a few short years, be turned the magazine on his head. He laid off several hundred workers.【Q25】 Especially hard hit were the blue and pink collar departments，such as subscription fulfillment.









乔治·格鲁恩于1984年接管读者文摘出版社后不久，开放了董事会的会议室，宣布该会议室现已向员工开放。这是一种象征性的行为，表明在格鲁恩的领导下，《读者文摘》将会有所不同。按照他的说法，格鲁恩重组了这里的文化。

为了了解我们所谈论的文化，思考格鲁恩开放的会议室。它有世界上任何博物馆都想要收集的艺术品，有莫奈和毕加索等许多世界著名艺术家创造的画作。其总部收藏着约3000件艺术品。主楼顶部是乔治亚风格的塔楼，里面有四尊神秘的飞马雕塑，这是该杂志的公司标志。它坐落在127英亩修剪整齐的草坪上。创始人德威特·华莱士曾使用编辑办公室。他和他的妻子莉拉·艾奇逊·华莱士于1922年推出《读者文摘》，里面刊登着其他出版物的精简文章。它已成为世界上阅读量最大的杂志，每月以17种语言发行41种不同版本，销售量达2800万册。华莱士夫妇都是教会牧师的孩子，对他们的“小杂志”有着清晰的准则，因为《读者文摘》最初是加有副标题的。文章简短、易读，令人振奋。被选中的主题具有启发性或娱乐性。直到1955年，华莱士夫妇才接受在美国版上刊登广告，即便如此，他们也不允许任何有关卷烟、酒类或毒品的广告。华莱士夫妇对他们想要的工作场所的类型有着清楚地认识。最初是一个夫妻经营的企业，没有生养子女的华莱士夫妇一直认为员工是他们家庭的一部分。员工们仍然会讲述华莱士夫妇如何照顾遭遇不幸的员工的故事，他们给员工带来了不同寻常的好处，比如感恩节的火鸡和5月份星期五均休假。这一舒适的工作场所已不复存在。20世纪80年代初期，华莱士夫妇均在90多岁的高龄去世。曾在1960年加入《读者文摘》的广告推销员乔治·格鲁恩将其目光锁定在止损点上。在短短数年间，他将杂志控制在他一人手上，解雇了数百名工人。特别是对像收取订阅费这样的蓝领和粉领部门打击较大。
