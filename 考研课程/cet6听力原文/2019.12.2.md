M: [1]Today, our guest is Rosie Hollander who works as a features editor for Fashion magazine. Hi, Rosie. You’re a features editor at one of the most widely read women’s magazines in the UK. What kind of responsibilities does that job entail?

W: We spend our days looking at ideas from journalists, writing copy for the magazine and website and editing. We do random things like asking people in the street questions and testing sports clothing. We also do less tangible things like understanding what our readers want. It’s certainly varied and sometimes bizarre.

M: During your working day, what kind of work might you typically do?

W: [2]My day mainly incorporates responding to emails, writing and editing stories and coming up with new feature ideas.

M: How does the job of features editor differ from that of fashion editor or other editorial positions?

W: The features team deals with articles such as careers, reports, confidence and confessions. Everything except fashion and beauty.

M: [3]A lot of people believe that working at a magazine is a glamorous job. Is this an accurate representation of what you do?

W: I’d say it’s glamorous to an extent, but not in the way is portrayed in films. We do have our moments such as interviewing celebrities and attending parties, which is a huge thrill. Ultimately though, we’re the same as our readers. But working in a job we’re all very lucky to have.

M: Did you have to overcome any difficulties to reach this point in your career? How did you manage to do this?

W: [4]I had to be really persistent and it was very hard work. After three years of working at a petrol station and doing unpaid work, I still hadn’t managed to get an entry level job. I was lucky that my last desperate attempt led to a job. I told myself that all experiences make you a better journalist in the long run. And luckily, I was right.

男：今天，我们的嘉宾是罗西·霍兰德（Rosie Hollander），她是时尚杂志的专题编辑。嗨，罗西。你在英国最受欢迎的女性杂志之一里做专题编辑，这项工作需要做些什么呢？

女：我们每天都在研究记者的想法，为杂志和网站撰写稿件，并进行编辑。我们也会随机地做一些事情，比如问街上的路人一些问题或帮着测试运动服。我们也做一些不太具体的事情，比如了解读者的需求。因为需求当然是多种多样的，有时甚至是很奇怪的。

男：上班的时候，你通常会做什么样的工作呢？

女：我每天的工作主要包括回复电子邮件、撰写和编辑故事，以及想出新的专题点子。

男：专题编辑的工作与时尚编辑或其他编辑职位有什么不同？

女：专题小组做过的文章包括职业、报告、信心和个人独白等，我们研究除了时尚和美丽之外的其他一切话题。

男：很多人都认为在杂志社工作很有吸引人。这是对你所做工作的准确描述吗？

女：我得说它在某种程度上是迷人的，但不是电影里描绘的那样。我们确实有采访名人和参加聚会的时刻，这让人十分激动。不过归根结底，我们和我们的读者没有区别，只是在这份工作中，很幸运地有这些机会。

男：在你的职业生涯中，你必须克服什么困难才能达到这一阶段吗？你是怎么做到的？

女：我必须不懈努力，这是非常辛苦的。我曾在加油站工作了三年，同时做额外的无薪工作，但还是没能找到一份初级的工作。我很幸运，最后一次孤注一掷的尝试得到了一份工作。我曾告诉自己，从长远来看，所有的经历都会使你成为一名更好的记者。幸运的是，我是对的。

W: Are you watching any good shows these days?

M: Actually, yes, I’m watching a great satire called *Frankie*. I think you’d like it.

W: Really? What’s it about?

M: It’s about a real guy named Frankie. He’s a famous comedian in New York. And the show is a mixture of comedy and drama loosely depicting his life.

W: I’m sorry. Do you mean to say it’s a real life series about a real person? It’s non-fiction, is it?

M: No, not really, no. It’s fiction, as what happens in every episode is made up. However, the lead role is a comedian by the name of Frankie and he plays himself. So Frankie, in both real life and in the TV show lives in New York City, is a comic, is divorced and has two little daughters. All those things are true. But aside from him, all his friends and family are played by actors. And the plots and events that take place are also invented.

W: Oh, I think I see now. That sounds like a very original concept.

M: Yes, it is. In fact, [6]the whole show is written, directed, edited and produced by him and [5] is very funny and has won many awards.

W: That’s cool. [7]I would try to download it. I’m watching a comedy called The Big Bang Theory. It’s a huge hit around the world.

M: Oh, yes, I’ve heard of it, but never actually watched it.

W: Well, then you should check it out. It’s also very funny. It’s about four male scientists and a female waitress. The men are very socially awkward, but very bright. And this is contrasted by the lady’s social skills and common sense. [8]This show has been running for over 10 years and some of the actors are practically global superstars. Now they are such famous celebrities.

5. What does the man think of the satire Frankie he recently watched?

6. What does the man say is special about the satire Frankie?

7. What does the woman say she was going to do with the satire Frankie?

8. What does the woman say about the comedy The Big Bang Theory?





女：这些天你有没有看什么好节目？

男：事实上我正在看一部很棒的讽刺作品，叫《弗兰基》（*Frankie*）。我想你会喜欢的。

女：真的吗？它讲了什么？

男：是关于一个叫弗兰基的真人的故事。他是纽约著名的喜剧演员。这部剧是喜剧和戏剧的结合体，大致描绘了他的生活。

女：不好意思，你是说这是一部关于真人真事的剧集吗？这不是虚构的，对吧？

男：不，不完全是。这是虚构的，因为每一集发生的事情都是编造的。然而，主角是一个名叫弗兰基的喜剧演员，他在剧中扮演自己。所以弗兰基，他在现实生活和电视剧中都生活在纽约，是一个喜剧演员，离过婚，有两个小女儿。这些都是真的。但是除了他，他的所有朋友和家人都是由演员扮演的，发生的情节和事件也是虚构的。

女：哦，我想我现在明白了，听起来很有创意。

男：是的。事实上，整个电视剧是由他自己撰写、导演、编辑和制作的，非常有趣，赢得了许多奖项。

女：太棒了，我会设法把它下载下来。我在看喜剧《生活大爆炸》，它在全世界都很受欢迎。

男：哦，是的，我听说过，但从没看过。

女：那你应该去看看。它也很有趣。它是关于四个男性科学家和一个女服务员的故事。这些男人不善交际，但很聪明。这与女服务员娴熟的社交技巧和常识形成了对比。这部剧已经上演了十多年，其中一些演员几乎是全球超级明星。现在他们都非常有名。

### Passage 1



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.





9. A) They are likely to get hurt when moving too fast.

B) They believe in team spirit.

C) They need to keep moving to avoid getting hurt.

D) They have to learn how to avoid body contact.

10. A) They do not have many years to live after retirement.

B) They tend to live longer with early retirement.

C) They do not start enjoying life until full retirement.

D) They keep themselves busy even after retirement.

11. A) It prevents us from worrying.

B) It slows down our aging process.

C) It enables us to accomplish in life.

D) It provides us with more chances to learn.





Related to the ‘use-it-or-lose-it law’ is the ‘keep-moving principle’. We learn about stagnation from nature. A river that stops moving gets smelly. The same thing happens to people who stop moving either mentally or physically. [9]Those who play contact sports know that the player who usually gets hurt the most is the one who is standing still. Of course you’ll need some time to catch your breath every so often, but the essential message is keep moving, extending and learning. Ships last a lot longer when they go to sea than when they stay in the harbor. The same is true for airplanes. You don’t preserve an airplane by keeping it on the ground. You preserve it by keeping it in service. We also get to live a long healthy life by staying in service. [10]Longevity statistics reveal that the average person doesn’t last very long after retirement. The more we’ll hear is don’t retire. If a fellow says, “I’m 94 years old and I’ve worked all my life”, we need to realize that is how we got to be 94, by staying involved. George Bernard Shaw won a Nobel Prize when he was nearly 70. Benjamin Franklin produced some of his best writings at the age of 84. And Pablo Picasso put brush to canvas right through his 80s. Isn’t the issue how old we think we are? [11]A bonus with the keep-moving principle is that while we keep moving, we don’t have a chance to worry. Hence, we avoid the dreaded paralysis by analysis.



9. What does the speaker say about players of contact sports?

10. What do longevity statistics reveal about the average person?

11. What bonus does the keep moving principal bring us according to the speaker?





与“要么使用，要么失去”法则相关的是“永不止步的原则”。我们从大自然中学到了停滞：一条河流停止流动就会变得臭气熏天。同样的事情也会发生在那些心理或身体停止活动的人身上。从事接触式运动的人都知道，受伤最严重的往往是那些站着不动的人。当然，你需要一些时间来时不时地喘口气，但最重要的是不断前进、努力和学习。船只出海时比停泊在港口时耐用得多。飞机也是如此，让飞机停在地面上并不能保养它，你得通过让它一直运行来保养它。通过保持工作状态，我们也能过上健康长寿的生活。寿命统计数据显示，普通人退休后活不了多久。我们听到的更多忠告是不要退休。如果一个人说:“我已经94岁了，我这辈子都在工作”，我们需要意识到，我们就是这样通过不断参与而活到94岁的。乔治·萧伯纳（George Bernard Shaw）在将近70岁的时候获得了诺贝尔奖。本杰明·富兰克林（Benjamin Franklin）最好的一部分作品是在他84岁的时候创作的。巴勃罗·毕加索（Pablo Picasso）直到80多岁还在画画。问题不是在于我们心中认为自己多大了吗？永不止步原则的额外好处是，当我们不断行动时，我们没有机会去忧虑。因此，我们避免了可怕的“分析麻痹”。

9. **讲话者如何评价接触式运动的运动员?**

A) 当他们行动太快时，很可能会受伤。

B) 他们相信团队精神。

C) 他们需要保持移动以避免受伤。

D) 他们必须学会如何避免身体接触。

【答案】C

10. **寿命统计数据显示普通人会如何？**

A) 他们退休后没有几年可活了。

B) 他们往往会因为提前退休而寿命更长。

C) 他们直到完全退休后才开始享受生活。

D) 他们甚至在退休后也很忙碌。

【答案】A

11. **根据讲话者所述，永不止步原则将带给我们什么好处？**

A) 它使我们不忧虑。

B) 它延缓我们的衰老过程。

C) 它使我们在生活中有所成就。

D) 它给我们提供了更多的学习机会。

【答案】A

D) Daydreamers did better than non-daydreamers in task performance.







In 2014, one in 16 Americans visited the hospital emergency room for home injuries. What are the main causes of these accidents? A wandering mind. [12]By one estimate, people daydream through nearly half of their waking hours. Psychologists have recently focused on the tendency to think about something other than the task one is doing. [13]For one experiment, researchers developed an app to analyze the relationship between daydreaming and happiness. They found that the average person’s mind wandered most frequently about 65 percent of the time during personal activities such as brushing their teeth and combing their hair. Respondents’ minds tended to wander more when they felt upset rather than happy. They were more likely to wander toward pleasant topics than unpleasant ones. How do daydreams affect daydreamers? A wandering mind leaves us vulnerable when driving. In one study, researchers interviewed 955 people involved in traffic accidents. The majority of them reported having daydreamed just before the accident.  [14]Yet other research suggests that daydreaming has benefits.Researchers have found that it gives us a chance to think about our goals, and it also seems to increase creativity. In one experiment, 145 undergraduates completed four unusual uses tasks, each requiring them to list as many uses as possible for an everyday object.[15]After the first pair of tasks was completed, one group of participants was assigned an undemanding activity intended to cause their minds to wander. When all the participants proceeded to the second pair of tasks, the daydreamers performed 40 percent better than the others.

12. What does the passage say about people’s mind?

13. For what purpose did the researchers develop the new app?

14. How does daydreaming benefit people according to some researchers?

15. What was the finding of the experiment with 145 undergraduates?







2014年，每16个美国人中就有一个在家里受伤到医院急诊室就诊。这些事故的主要原因是什么？他们走神了。据估计，人们醒着的时候几乎有一半时间在做白日梦。心理学家最近关注到，人们倾向于去思考一些其他事情而不是手头正在做的事情。在一个实验中，研究人员开发了一个应用程序来分析白日梦和幸福感之间的关系。他们发现，普通人在刷牙和梳头等个人活动时时最常走神，时间约占65%。当受访者感到烦恼而不是快乐时，他们更容易走神。与不愉快的话题相比，他们更可能去想愉快的话题。白日梦是如何影响白日梦者的？走神使我们在开车时容易发生危险。在一项研究中，研究人员采访了955名涉及交通事故的人。他们中的大多数人说事故发生前就在做白日梦。然而，其他研究表明，做白日梦也有好处。研究人员发现，它给了我们思考目标的机会，而且似乎还能提高创造力。在一项实验中，145名大学生完成了四项“不同寻常的用途”任务，每项任务都要求他们列出一件日常用品尽可能多的用途。在完成了第一组任务后，一组参与者被分配了一项轻松的活动，目的是让他们走神。当所有参与者进行第二组任务时，白日梦者的表现比其他人好40%。

12. **根据这篇文章所述，人的思维会怎样？**、

A) 它倾向于细想快乐的经历。

B) 人们醒着的时候，一半的时间都在走神。

C) 大脑损伤后很难集中注意力。

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16. A) They are the oldest buildings in Europe.

B) They are part of the Christian tradition.

C) They are renovated to attract tourists.

D) They are in worsening condition.

17. A) They have a history of 14 centuries.

B) They are 40 metres tall on average.

C) They are without foundations.

D) They consist of several storeys.

18. A) Wood was harmonious with nature.

B) Wooden buildings kept cold out.

C) Timber was abundant in Scandinavia.

D) The Vikings liked wooden structures.







Dating from as far back as the 12th century, they are claimed to be the rarest historic buildings in Western Europe. These buildings offer vital insights into Scandinavia’s Viking past. [16] But now, with only 30 wooden churches remaining and their condition deteriorating, experts are working to preserve the structures for future generations.

Some of these spectacular churches are no more than small buildings, barely four metres wide and six metres tall. Others are much larger structures that soar up to 40 metres into the cold air. [17]Most consist of timber frames that rest on stone blocks. This means that they have no foundations. Although many of the churches appear from the outside to be complex structures, they normally feature only a single story but numerous different roof levels.

Staffs from the Norwegian government have carried out conservation work on 10 of the churches over the past two years. Most of these churches date from between the 12th and 14th centuries. Other churches were conserved in previous years. So far, specialists have worked to add preservative materials to the church’s exteriors. They also replaced rotting rooms and halted the sinking of the churches into the ground. In two cases, huge machines have been used to lift the buildings up to 30 centimetres into the air. This was accomplished so that the team could examine and repair the church’s original medieval stone blocks. The team plans to return to around a dozen of the buildings to assess progress and consider further action.

The earliest three standing wooden church was probably built in Norway in around 1080. However, the largest known wooden churches were built from the 1130 onwards. This period was one of intra-elite rivalry in which nobles sought to increase their influence by funding the construction of churches and other buildings. [18]The reason for constructing the buildings from wood is probably that ideally proportioned straight and slender timber was available in large quantities in Scandinavia’s vast pine forests. As wood was so plentiful, it was cheaper to use than the stone used in the buildings of other European cultures. The area’s ship building tradition, partly established by the Vikings, also meant that sophisticated carpentry was a major aspect of the local culture. The complex style of the medieval wooden church carvings and the skills used to make them almost certainly derive from the ancient Viking tradition.

16. What does the speaker say about the Viking wooden churches?

17. What is special about most of the Viking wooden churches?

18. Why were the Viking churches constructed from wood?





它们被认为是西欧最珍贵的历史建筑,历史可以追溯到12世纪。这些建筑为人们了解斯堪的纳维亚的维京历史提供了重要的视角。但是现在，只有30座木制教堂保留下来，且它们的状况每况愈下，专家们正在努力为后代保护这些结构。

这些令人惊叹的的教堂中有些不过是一些小建筑物，只有4米宽，6米高。其他的则是更大的建筑物，矗立在40米的高空中。大部分由木构架支撑在石块上，这意味着它们没有地基。虽然许多教堂从外观上看是复杂的结构，但它们通常只有一层，不过有许多不同的屋顶。

挪威政府的工作人员在过去两年中对其中10座教堂进行了保护，这些教堂大多建于12世纪到14世纪之间。而其他教堂在前几年得到了保护。到目前为止，专家们一直致力于在教堂的外部添加保护材料。他们还更换了朽化的房间，阻止了教堂沉入地下的趋势。在两个案例中，工作人员使用巨大的机器将建筑物抬到30厘米高的空中，这是为了让团队能够检查和修复教堂的原始中世纪石块。该团队计划选择大约12座建筑来评估进度并考虑采取进一步行动。

最早的三座立式木制教堂可能建于1080年左右的挪威。然而，已知最大的木制教堂是从1130年开始建造的。这一时期是贵族内部争斗的时期，贵族们试图通过资助建造教堂和其他建筑来增加他们的影响力。用木材建造建筑的原因可能是在斯堪的纳维亚广袤的松林中存在大量比例匀称的直而细长的木材。由于木材非常丰富，所以它比其他欧洲文化的建筑中使用的石材更便宜。该地区的造船传统部分是由维京人开创的，它意味着精致的木工是当地文化的一个主要方面。中世纪木制教堂雕刻的复杂风格和制作技巧几乎可以肯定起源于古维京的传统。



16. **讲话者如何评价维京木制教堂?**

A) 它们是欧洲最古老的建筑。

B) 它们是基督教传统的一部分。

C) 为了吸引游客，它们进行了翻新。

D) 它们的情况正在恶化。

【答案】D

17. **大多数维京木质教堂有什么特别之处？**

A) 它们的历史长达14个世纪。

B) 它们平均高达40米。

C) 它们没有地基。

D) 它们由几层楼组成。

【答案】C

18. **为什么维京教堂是用木头建造的？**

A) 木材与自然和谐相处。

B) 木质建筑物不受寒冷的侵袭。

C) 斯堪的纳维亚地区木材丰富。

D) 维京人喜欢木制结构。

【答案】C

### Recording 2



Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.





19. A) Similarities between human babies and baby animals.

B) Cognitive features of different newly on bom mammals.

C) Adults influence on children.

D) Abilities of human babies.

20. A) They can distinguish a happy tune from a sad one.

C) They fall asleep easily while listening to music.

D) They are already sensitive to beats and rhythms.

21. A) Infants’ facial expressions.

B) Babies' emotions.

C) Babies'  interaction with adult.

D) Infants’ behaviors.







In last week’s lecture, we discussed the characteristics of the newly born offspring of several mammals. You probably remember that human infants are less developed physically than other mammals of the same age. [19]But in today’s lecture, we’ll look at three very interesting studies that hint at the surprising abilities of human babies.

In the first study, three year olds watch two videos shown side by side, each featuring a different researcher, one of whom they’d met once two years earlier. The children spent longer watching the video showing the researcher they hadn’t met. This is consistent with young children’s usual tendency to look longer at things that aren’t familiar. And really, this is amazing. It suggests that children remembered the researcher they’d met just one time when they were only one year olds. Of course, as most of us forget memories from our first few years, as we grow older, these early long-term memories will likely be lost in subsequent years.

[20]Our second study is about music. For this study, researchers played music to babies through speakers located on either side of a human face. They waited until the babies got bored and averted their gaze from the face. And then they changed the mood in music, either from sad to happy or the other way around. [20]This mood switch made no difference to the three month olds, but for the nine month olds it was enough to renew their interest, and they started looking again in the direction of the face. This suggests that babies of that age can tell the difference between a happy melody and a sad tune.

. [21]Our final study is from 1980. But it’s still relevant today. In fact, it’s one of the most famous pieces of research about infant emotion ever published. The study involved ordinary adults watching video clips of babies nine months or younger. In the video clips, the babies made various facial expressions in response to real life events, including playful interactions and painful ones. The adult observers were able to reliably discern an assortment of emotions on the babies’ faces. These emotions included interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt and fear.

Next week, we’ll be looking at this last study more closely. In fact, we will be viewing some of the video clips from that study and together, see how well we do in discerning the baby’s emotions.

19. What are the three interesting studies about?

20. What does the second study find about nine month old babies?

21. What is the 1980 study about?





在上周的讲座中，我们讨论了几种哺乳动物新生后代的特征。你可能还记得，人类婴儿的身体不如其他同龄哺乳动物发达。但是在今天的讲座中，我们将会看到三个非常有趣的研究，它们暗示了人类婴儿惊人的能力。

在第一项研究中，三岁的孩子们一起观看了两段视频，每一段中都出现了不同的研究人员，其中一人是他们两年前见过的。孩子们花了更长的时间来观看他们没有见过的研究人员的视频，这与小孩子倾向于长时间看不熟悉的东西是一致的。这真的很神奇。这表明孩子们记得他们一岁时只见过一次的研究员。当然，随着年龄的增长，我们大多数人都会忘记最初几年的记忆，这些早期的长期记忆很可能会在随后的几年里丢失。

我们的第二项研究是关于音乐的。在这项研究中，研究人员通过位于人脸两侧的扬声器向婴儿播放音乐。他们一直等到婴儿们厌烦了并把目光从人脸上移开，然后改变音乐的情绪，从悲伤变成快乐，或者正好相反。这种情绪转换对三个月大的婴儿没有影响，但对九个月大的婴儿来说，这就足以让他们重新产生兴趣，他们开始再次看向人脸的方向。这表明这个年龄的婴儿能分辨出快乐的旋律和悲伤的曲调。

我们最后的研究始于1980年，但它在今天仍然很有价值。事实上，这是迄今为止发表的最著名的关于婴儿情绪的研究之一。这项研究让普通成年人观看9个月或更小婴儿的视频片段。在视频片段中，婴儿们对现实生活中的事件做出各种各样的面部表情，包括顽皮的和痛苦的互动。成年观察者能够确切地分辨出婴儿脸上的各种情绪，包括感兴趣、喜悦、惊讶、悲伤、愤怒、厌恶、轻蔑和恐惧。

下周，我们会更仔细地分析最后一项研究。事实上，我们将观看这项研究中的一些视频片段，一起看看我们在识别婴儿情绪方面做得有多好。

19. **这三项有趣的研究是关于什么的？**

A) 动物宝宝和人类宝宝之间的相似性。

B) 不同新生哺乳动物的认知特征。

C) 成年人对孩子的影响。

D) 人类婴儿的能力。

【答案】D

20. **关于9个月大的婴儿，第二项研究发现了什么？**

A) 他们能分辨出快乐的和悲伤的曲调。

B) 他们喜欢快乐的旋律胜过悲伤的。

C) 他们听音乐时很容易睡着。

D) 他们已经对节拍和节奏很敏感了。

【答案】A

21. **1980年的研究是关于什么的？**

Today, I’d like to talk about the dangers of being too collaborative. Being a good team player is an essential skill in our modern workplace. The ability to work well with others and collaborate on projects is a sought-after ability in nearly every position. [22]However, placing too much emphasis on being a good team player can negatively affect your career growth. Don’t be overly focused on gaining consensus. Don’t be too concerned with the opinions of others. This can hinder your ability to make decisions, speak up and gain recognition for your individual skills and strengths. Some people are too subordinate to others’ opinions, too focused on decision consensus, too silent about their own points of view, too agreeable to take things on when they don’t have time or energy. [22]This leads to building a brand of underconfident, submissive, low-impact non-leaders and hampers their growth and career advancement.

[23]Collaboration certainly makes your individual competencies and contributions more difficult for outsiders to identify. Collaborative projects mean sharing the spotlight with others. Outsiders may then find it difficult to determine your contributions and strengths. This may end up costing you opportunities for promotions or pay raises. You certainly shouldn’t ditch teamwork, but how can you avoid the hazards of being an over-collaborator?

[24]Working in a team can have huge benefits. Your team may have repeated successes and often gain recognition. You’ll then have more opportunities to expand your professional network than if you worked alone. However, finding a balance between team efforts and individual projects that give you independent recognition is important for making a name for yourself and providing opportunities for advancement.

Be selective in who you work with. This will maximize the benefits and minimize the downsides of being a team player. Collaborate with people who have complementary expertise. Select projects where there’s potential for mutual benefit. Perhaps you’re bringing your unique knowledge and gaining access to someone else’s professional network, or maybe you’re able to learn a new skill by working with someone. Seek out your team-mates purposefully rather than jumping on every new group project opportunity.[25]When we are too collaborative, we want everyone to agree with a decision before we proceed. This can create unnecessary delays as you hold meetings trying to achieve a consensus. It’s fine to be collaborative when seeking input, but put a deadline on the input stage and arrive at a decision, even if it’s a decision that doesn’t have consensus.

22. What does the speaker say about being over collaborative?

今天，我想谈谈过于注重合作的危险。在现代职场中，成为一名优秀的团队合作者是一项基本技能。在几乎每个职位上，与他人良好合作并在项目中协作的能力都是很受欢迎的。然而，过于强调团队合作精神会对你的职业发展产生负面影响。不要过度关注达成共识，不要太在意别人的意见，这可能会阻碍你做出决定、畅所欲言、获得对个人技能和优势的认可。有些人太屈从于别人的意见，太专注于决策共识，对自己的观点太沉默，太容易在明明没有时间和精力的时候承担工作。这会导致建立一个不自信、顺从、影响力低的非领导者形象，阻碍他们的成长和职业发展。

合作无疑会使你的个人能力和个人贡献更难被外人发现。合作项目意味着与他人分享关注，外人可能会发现很难明确你的贡献和优势。这可能会让你失去升职或加薪的机会。你当然不应该放弃团队合作，但如何才能避免成为过度合作者的危险呢？

在一个团队中工作有很大的好处。你的团队可能多次获得成功，并经常获得认可，这样你就比独自工作时有更多的机会扩展你的职业网络。然而，在团队工作和个人项目之间找到一个能给予你独立认可的平衡点，这对你赢得名声和得到晋升机会是很重要的。

认真挑选和谁一起工作，这将最大限度地发挥团队合作的好处，也可以最大限度地减少团队合作的负面影响。与具有互补专业知识的人合作，选择那些有可能互惠互利的项目。也许你贡献了自己独特的知识并接触了别人的专业网络中，或者你可以通过和别人一起工作来学习一项新技能。有目的地寻找你的队友，而不是抓住每一个新的团队项目机会。当我们过度合作时，我们希望正式实施某个决定前每个人都同意。当你召开会议试图达成共识时，这可能会造成不必要的延误。在寻求意见的时候，合作是可以的，但是意见征询要有最后期限，即使没有达成共识，也要做出最后决定。
