### Conversation 1



M: What’s all that? Are you going to make a salad?

W: No, I’m going to make a gazpacho.

M: What’s that?

W: Gazpacho is a cold soup from Spain.【Q1】 It’s mostly vegetables. I guess you could call it a liquid salad.

M: Cold soup? Sounds weird.

W: It’s delicious. Trust me. I tried it for the first time during my summer vacation in Spain. You see, in the south of Spain, it gets very hot in the summer, up to 40°C. So a cold gazpacho is very refreshing. The main ingredients are tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, olive oil and stale bread.

M: Stale bread? Surely you mean bread for dipping into the soup?

W: No. Bread is crushed and blended in like everything else. It adds texture and thickness to the soup.【Q2】

M: Mm. And is it healthy?

W: Sure. As I said earlier it’s mostly vegetables.【Q3】 You can also add different things if you like, such as hard-boiled egg or cured ham.

M: Cured ham? What’s that?

W: That’s another Spanish delicacy. Have you never heard of it? It is quite famous.

M: No, is it good too?

W: Oh, yeah, definitely. It’s amazing. It’s a little dry and salty, and it’s very expensive because it comes from a special type of pig that only eats a special type of food.【Q4】 The harm is covered in salt to dry and preserve it. And left to hang for up to two years, it has a verydistinct flavor.

M: Mm. Sounds interesting. Where can I find some?

W: It used to be difficult to get Spanish produce here. But it’s now a lot more common. Most large supermarket chains have cured ham in little packets but in Spain you can buy a whole leg.

M: A whole pig leg? Why would anybody want so much ham?

W: In Spain, many people buy a whole leg for special group events, such as Christmas. They cut it themselves into very thin slices with a long flat knife.



男：这些是什么？你要做沙拉吗？

女：不是的，我要做西班牙凉菜汤。

男：那是什么？

女：西班牙凉菜汤是来自西班牙的一种冷汤。主要是蔬菜。我想你可以叫它液体沙拉。

男：冷汤？听起来很奇怪。

女：味道鲜美。相信我。我第一次做是我在西班牙过暑假的时候。你知道的，在西班牙南部，夏天非常热，气温高达40°C。所以，一道冷的西班牙凉菜汤非常消暑。主要食材有西红柿、黄瓜、甜椒，橄榄油和陈面包。

男：陈面包？确定你意思是说把面包浸入汤里面吗？

女：不是的。像其它食材一样，要把面包碾碎，与汤混合。它增加了汤的质地和浓度。

男：嗯，这样健康吗？

女：当然了。正如我之前说的，它主要都是蔬菜。如果你喜欢，你还能加入一些不同的东西，比如煮熟的鸡蛋或腌火腿。

男：腌火腿？那是什么？

女：另一道西班牙美味佳肴。你从来没有听说过吗？非常有名。

男：没有。它也很好吃吗？

女：哦，当然，绝对的。令人惊艳。它有点干，有点咸，而且非常昂贵，因为它来自一种只吃特殊类型食物的特殊类型的猪。火腿上面抹上一层盐，风干保存。而且挂起来风干时间长达两年，风味非常独特。

男：嗯，听上去很有趣。在哪里我能买到一些呢？

女：过去这里通常很难买到西班牙制品。但现在常见多了。大多数大型连锁超市都有小袋装的腌火腿，但在西班牙你能买到一整条腿。

男：一整条猪腿？为什么人们会想要这么多火腿呢？

女：在西班牙，诸如圣诞等特别群体活动时，许多人会买一整条腿，然后用一把长长的平口刀切成非常薄的薄片。

### Conversation 2



Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

5.A)They come in a great variety.

B)They go well with Italian food.

C)They do not make decent gifts.

D)They do not vary much in price.



6.A)Around $150.

B)$50-$60.

C)$40-$50.

D)$30-$40.



7.A)They go well with different kinds of food.

B)They symbolize good health and longevity.

C)They are especially popular among Italians.

D)They are a healthy choice for elderly people.



8.A)It is a wine imported from California.

B)It is far more expensive than he expected.

C)It is Italy’s most famous type of red wine.

D)It is less spicy than all other red wines.





M: Hello. I wish to buy a bottle of wine.

W: Hi, yes. What kind of wine would you like?

M: I don’t know. Sorry, I don’t know much about wine.

W: That’s no problem at all. What’s the occasion and how much would you like to spend?

M: It’s for my boss. It’s his birthday. I know he likes wine, but I don’t know what type. I also do not want anything too expensive, maybe mid-range. How much would you say is a mid-range bottle of wine approximately?

W: Well, it varies greatly. Our lowest prices are around 6 dollars a bottle, but those are table wines. They are not very special and I would not suggest them as a gift.【Q5】 On the other end, our most expensive bottles are over 150 dollars. If you are looking for something priced in the middle, I would say anything between 30 dollars and 60 dollars would make a decent gift. How does that sound?

M: Mm, yeah. I guess something in the vicinity of 30 or 40 would be good.【Q6】 Which type would you recommend?

W: I would say the safest option is always a red wine. They are generally more popular than whites and can usually be paired with food more easily.【Q7】 Our specialty here are Italian wines and these tend to be fruity with medium acidity. This one here is chianti which is perhaps Italy’s most famous type of red wine.【Q8-1】Alternatively, you may wish to try and surprise your boss with something less common such as this Zinfandel. The grapes are originally native to Croatia, but this winery is in eastern Italy and it has a more spicy and peppery flavor. So to summarize, the Chianti is more classical and the zinfandel more exciting. Both are similarly priced at just under 40 dollars.

M：I will go with Chianti then, thanks.【Q8-2】







男：你好。我想买一瓶葡萄酒。

女：嗨，好的。你想要什么样的葡萄酒？

男：我不知道。不好意思，我对葡萄酒了解不多。

女：完全没问题。用于什么场合，你想花多少钱？

男：这是给我的老板，为他生日准备的。我知道他喜欢葡萄酒，但我不知道是什么类型。我也不想买太昂贵的东西，可能是中档。你说一瓶中档的葡萄酒大概是多少钱？

女：差别很大。我们这里价格最低的是每瓶6美金左右，但那些是佐餐酒。它们不是很特别，我不建议选它们作为礼物。另一方面，我们最昂贵的酒都在150美金以上。如果你要找价格中等的酒，我想30~60美金之间的葡萄酒都是一件体面的礼物。听上去怎么样？

男：恩……，好的！我想在30或40左右的东西就很好。你会推荐哪种类型？

女：我想最安全的选择总是红酒。它们通常比白葡萄酒更受欢迎，而且通常可以更容易与食物搭配。我们的特产是意大利葡萄酒，而且这些葡萄酒大都为中等酸度的果味口感。其中一个品牌是基昂蒂（Chianti），它可能是意大利最著名的红酒。或者，您也许想尝试使用不太常见的东西，给您的老板带去惊喜，如Zinfandel。这种酒的葡萄原产于克罗地亚，但这家酒庄位于意大利东部，味道更辣更强劲。总而言之，基昂蒂更加经典，而Zinfandel更令人兴奋。两者价格均不到40美金。

男：那我买基昂蒂，谢谢。

### Passage 1



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.



9.A)Learning others secrets.

B)Decoding secret messages.

C)Searching for information.

D)Spreading sensational news.



10.A)They were good at breaking enemy secret codes.

B)They were assigned to decode enemy messages.

C)They could write down spoken codes promptly.

D)They helped the U.S. army in World War Ⅱ.



11.A)A military code that was never broken.

B)Decoding of secret messages in war times.

C)Important battles fought in the Pacific War.

D)Navajo Indians’ contribution to code breaking.







Many people enjoy secret codes. The harder the code, the more some people will try to figure it out.【Q9】 In wartime, codes are especially important. They help army send news about battles and the size of enemy forces. Neither side wants its code broken by the other.

One very important code was never broken.【Q 11】It was used during World War II by the Americans. It was a spoken code never written down and it was developed and used by Navajo Indians.【Q10】They were called the Navajo code talkers. The Navajos created the code in their own language. Navajo is hard to learn and only a few people know it. So it was pretty certain that the enemy would not be able to understand the code talkers. In addition, the talkers used code words. They called a submarine, an iron fish and a small bomb thrown by hand a potato. If they wanted to spell something, they used code words for letters of the Alphabet. For instance, the letter A was aunt or apple or X.

The code talkers worked mostly in the islands in the Pacific. One or two would be assigned to a group of soldiers. They would send messages by field telephone to the code talker in the next group. And he would relay the information to his commander. The code talkers played an important part in several battles. They helped troops coordinate their movements and attacks. After the war, the U.S. government honored them for what they had accomplished. Theirs was the most successful wartime code ever used.



许多人喜欢密码。密码越难，一些人就越想找出答案。在战时，密码尤为重要。它们帮助军队发送有关战争和敌军规模的消息。双方都不希望自己的密码被另一方破解。

有一个非常重要的代码从来没有被破解过。它是二战期间由美国人所使用的密码。这是一种从来没有被写出来的口语代码，由纳瓦霍印第安人开发和使用。他们被称为纳瓦霍语编码者。纳瓦霍用自己的语言创建了密码。纳瓦霍语很难学，只有少数人知道。所以很明显，敌人无法理解编码者。此外，讲话的人使用加密词。他们称潜水艇为铁鱼，手扔的小型炸弹为土豆。如果他们想拼写一些东西，他们会使用代码字来表示字母表中的字母。比如，字母A是阿姨或苹果或X。



密码交流者主要在太平洋的岛屿上工作。他们中的一人或两人被分配给一组士兵。他们将通过现场电话向下一组的密码交流者发送消息。再由对方将信息传递给指挥官。在几场战役中，密码交流者发挥了重要作用。他们帮助部队协调他们的行动和进攻。战后，美国政府表彰了他们所取得的成就。他们的密码是曾使用过的最成功的战时密码。



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.

9.What does the speakers say many people enjoy doing?

B)The rising demand in education and healthcare in the next 20years.

C)The amazing amount of personal attention people would like to have.

D)The tremendous changes new technology will bring to people’s lives.



If you are young and thinking about your career, you’ll want to know where you can make a living. Well, there’s going to be a technological replacement of a lot of knowledge-intensive jobs in the next twenty years,【Q12】particularly in the two largest sectors of the labor force with professional skills. One is teaching， and the other healthcare. You have so many applications and software and platforms that are going to come in and provide information and service in these two fields, which means a lot of healthcare and education sectors will be radically changed and a lot of jobs will be lost. Now where will the new jobs be found? Well, the one sector of the economy that can’t be easily duplicated by even smart technologies is the caring sector.【Q13】The personal care sector that is you can’t really get a robot to do a great massage or physical therapy, or you can’t get the kind of personal attention you need with regard to therapy or any other personal service. There could be very high-end personal services. Therapists do charge a lot of money.【Q14】 I think there’s no limit to the amount of personal attention and personal care, people would like if they could afford it. But the real question in the future is how come people afford these things if they don’t have money， because they can’t get a job that pays enough. That’s why I wrote this book which is about how to reorganize the economy for the future when technology brings about disruptive changes to what we used to consider high-income work.【Q15】





如果你年轻，想着你的事业，你会想知道你可以谋生的地方。那么，在未来的20年里，将会由技术替代大量知识密集型工作，特别是在拥有专业技能的两大劳动力领域。一个是教学，另一个是医疗保健。你们有这么多的应用程序、软件和平台，它们将进入这两个领域并提供信息和服务，这意味着很多医疗保健和教育部门将会发生根本性变化，将会失去很多工作。个人护理的工作内容不可能轻易地被技术取代，即使是智能技术也不行。个人护理部门无法真正让机器人做出一次很棒的按摩或理疗，或者您无法获得您需要的关于物理疗法或任何其他个人服务的个人关注。可能会有非常高端的个人服务。理疗师确实收费很高。我认为个人关注和个人护理的数量是没有限制的，如果人们可以负担得起，他们会喜欢的。但是，未来的真正问题是，如果人们没有钱，人们如何负担得起这些东西，因为他们找不到足以支付这些费用的工作。当技术将给我们曾认为是高收入的工作带来颠覆性的变化时，如何重组未来的经济，这也是为什么我写这本书的原因。

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16.A)It lay 8 miles from the monument sites.

B)It was the longest road in ancient Egypt.

C)It linked a stone pit to some waterways.

D)It was constructed some 500 years ago.



17.A)Some stone tool segments.

B)Saws used for cutting stone.

C)An ancient geographical map.

D)Traces left by early explorers.



18.A)To provide services for the stone pit.

B)To transport stones to block floods.

C)To link the various monument sites.

D)To connect the villages along the Nile.





American researchers have discovered the world’s oldest paved road, a 4,600-year-old highway. It linked a Stone Pit in the Egyptian desert to waterways that carried blocks to monument sites along the Nile.【Q16】 The Eight Mile Road is at least 500 years older than any previously discovered road. “It is the only paved road discovered in ancient Egypt,” said geologist Thomas Bown of the United States Geological Survey. He reported the discovery on Friday. “The road probably doesn’t rank with the pyramids as a construction feat, but it is a major engineering achievement”, said his colleague geologist James Harrell of the University of Toledo, “Not only is the road earlier than we thought possible, we didn’t even think they built roads”. The researchers also made a discovery in the stone pit at the northern end of the road. The first evidence that the Egyptians used rock saws.【Q17】 “This is the oldest example of saws being used for cutting stone”, said Brown’s colleague James Hoffmeier of Wheaton College in Illinois. “That’s two technologies we didn’t know they had”, Howell said, “And we don’t know why they were both abandoned.” The road was discovered in the “Faiyum Depression” about 45 miles southwest of Cairo. “Short segments of the road had been observed by earlier explorers”, Bown said, “But they failed to realize its significance or follow up on their observations.” Bown and his colleagues stumbled across it while they were doing geological mapping in the region. The road was clearly built to provide services for the newly discovered stone pit.【Q18】 Bown and Harrel have found the camp that housed workers at the stone pit. The road appears today to go nowhere, ending in the middle of the desert. When it was built, its terminal was a dock on the shore of Lake Moeis which had an elevation of about 66 feet above sea level, the same as the dock. Lake Moeis received its water from the annual floods of the Nile. At the time of the floods, the river and lake were at the same level and connected through a gap in the hills near the modern villages of el-Lahun and Hawara. Harrel and Bown believe that blocks were loaded onto barges during the dry season, then floated over to the Nile during the floods to be shipped off to the monument sites at Giza and Saqqara.



美国研究人员发现了世界上最古老的铺砌道路，这是一条拥有4600年历史的高速公路。它将埃及沙漠中的采石场与水路连接起来，而水路将石块运往尼罗河沿岸的古迹遗址。“八里路”比以往发现的任何道路的历史都至少长500年。 “这是古埃及发现的唯一铺设好的道路，”美国地质调查局的地质学家托马斯·布恩说。他周五报道了这一发现。他在托莱多大学的同事地质学家詹姆斯·哈雷尔说：“这条公路可能并不像是金字塔那样的建筑壮举，但它是一项重大的工程成果。不仅是修建这条道路比我们想象得更早，而且我们甚至不认为他们会修路。”研究人员还在道路北端的采石场中有了一个新的发现。埃及人首次使用石锯的证据。 “这是使用锯子切割石头的最古老的例子，”布朗在伊利诺伊州惠顿学院的同事詹姆斯·霍夫迈耶说,“我们不知道他们拥有这两种技术，”豪厄尔说：“而且我们也不知道这两种技术为何被弃用了。”这条道路是在开罗西南约45英里的“菲律宾坳陷”中发现的。布恩说到：“早期探险者观测到了很短的路段，但他们没有意识到其意义，也没有跟踪他们的观察结果。”布恩和他的同事在该地区进行地质测绘时，偶然发现了这一点。修建这条公路显然是为新发现的采石场提供服务。布恩和哈雷尔发现了在采石场内安置工人的营地。如今这条道路似乎不通往任何地方，在沙漠中央中断了。当它建成时，其终点是莫里斯湖岸边的一个码头，海拔约66英尺，与码头相同。尼罗河每年一次的洪水涌入莫耶湖。在洪水发生时，河流和湖泊处于同一海拔高度，并通过现在村落拉罕和哈瓦拉附近的山丘之间的峡谷连接起来。哈雷尔和布恩认为，在干旱季节，石块被装上驳船，然后在洪水期间漂浮到尼罗河，运往间歇泉和桑卡拉的古迹遗址。

### Recording 3



Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording you have just heard.

22.A)They argued persistently about whether to have children.

B)They quarreled a lot and never resolved their arguments.

C)They were compatible despite differences.

D)They were on the verge of breaking up.



23.A)They weren’t spoiled in their childhood.

B)Neither of them won their parents’ favor.

C)Neither of them has any brothers or sisters.

D)They didn’t like to be the apple of their parents’ eyes.



24.A)They tend to be self-assured and responsible.

B)They are often content with what they have.

C)They tend to be adventurous and creative.

D)They are usually good at making friends.



25.A)They enjoy making friends.

B)They are least likely to take initiative.

C)They usually have successful marriages.

D)They tend to be well adjusted.





Ronald and Lois, married for two decades, consider themselves a happy couple, but in the early years of their marriage, both were distilled by persistent arguments that seemed to fade away without ever being truly resolved.【Q22】 They uncovered clues to what was going wrong by researching a fascinating subject: how birth order affects not only your personality, but also how compatible you are with your mate.

Ronald and Lois are only children,【Q23】 and “onlies” grow up accustomed to being the apples of their parents’ eyes. Match two “onlies” and you have partners who subconsciously expect each other to continue fulfilling this expectation, while neither has much experience in the “giving” end.

Here’s a list of common birth-order characteristics and some thoughts on the best (and worst) marital matches for each:

The oldest tends to be self-assured, responsible, a high achiever and relatively serious and reserved.【Q24】 He may be slow to make friends, perhaps content with only one companion. The best matches are with a youngest, an “only”, or a mate raised in a large family. The worst match is with another oldest, since the two will be too sovereign to share a household comfortably. The youngest child of the family thrives on attention and tends to be outgoing, adventurous, optimistic, creative and less ambitious than others in the family. He may lack self-discipline and have difficulty making decisions on his own.

A youngest brother of brothers, often unpredictable and romantic, will match best with an oldest sister of brothers. The youngest sister of brothers is best matched with an oldest brother of sisters who will happily indulge these traits.

The middle child is influenced by many variables; however, middles are less likely to take initiative and more anxious and self-critical than others.

Middles often successfully marry other middles, since both are strong on tact, not so strong on aggressiveness and tend to crave affection.

The only child is often most comfortable when alone, but since an “only” tends to be a well-adjusted individual,【Q25】 she’ll eventually learn to relate to any chosen spouse.

The male only child expects his wife to make life easier without getting much in return; he is sometimes best matched with a younger sister of brothers. The female only child, who tends to be slightly more flexible, is well matched with an older man, who will indulge her tendency to test his love. Her worst match? Another “only”, of course.





结婚二十年的罗纳德和露易丝认为他们是一对幸福的夫妇，然而在他们最初几年的婚姻生活里，两人都为持续的争论感到恼怒，这些争论似乎在没有真正解决的情况下便渐渐消失了。通过研究一个引人入胜的主题，他们揭示了出现问题的线索：出生顺序不仅影响你的性格，还影响你与伴侣的和睦共处的程度。

罗纳德和露易丝均是独生子女，独生长大，习惯了当父母的掌上明珠。两个独生子女的婚姻，潜意识里都期望对方继续履行这个期望，然而双方都在“给予”方面没有太多的经验。

这里列出了常见的出生顺序特征以及关于各自最佳（和最差）婚配的一些想法：

老大往往比较自信，负责任，事业高度成功，相对严肃和保守。他可能结交朋友会比较慢，也许有一名同伴就感到满足了。最相配的就是最年幼的、独生子或大家庭中长大的成员。最糟糕的就是与另一个老大结婚，因为他们都太过独立自主，而无法舒适地在一个家庭里生活。家庭中最小的孩子在家庭中表现出色，他们往往性格外向，充满冒险精神，乐观，富有创造力，而且比家庭中其他人更没有雄心壮志。 他可能缺乏自律，难以自己做出决定。

兄弟中最年幼的弟弟往往变幻莫测，浪漫，与兄弟姐妹中最年长的姐姐最相配。兄弟姐妹中最年幼的妹妹与兄弟姐妹中最年长的哥哥最相配，他们很乐意放纵这些特质。

中间的孩子受许多不定因素影响；然而，中间的孩子不太可能采取主动，比其他人更加焦虑和律己。

中间年龄层的孩子往往更容易与其他家庭中间年龄层的孩子结婚，因为他们都性格坚韧并且不太强势，同时很渴望爱情。

独生子女在独处时常常最舒服，但因为是“独生的”，往往是能很好适应环境的个体，她最终会学会维系任何她所选择的伴侣。

独生子期望他的妻子让生活变得更轻松，而不要很多回报；他有时与兄弟姐妹中的妹妹最相配。独生女往往更灵活一些，与年长的男性相匹配，能放纵她来测试他的爱。最糟糕的婚配呢？当然是另一个独生子。
