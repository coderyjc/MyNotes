W: You are going to give a short speech of thanks for the speaker this evening, aren’t you, Bill?

M: Yes.【Q1】

W: You don’t sound very enthusiastic. It’s not that bad, is it?

M: No. I don’t mind, really. But I can never forget the first speech of thanks I did.

W: Why? What happened?

M: Well, I was in my early twenties. I joined the local history society.【Q2】

W: Yes?

M: Anyway，I went along to a lecture by a Miss Bligh.

W: Oh. Do go on.

M: She was going to talk with slides about our town in the mid-18th century. She had just published a book on the subject which was reckoned to be quite good.【Q3】 So l went along. When I arrived, the secretary asked me if I could give the speech of thanks. Rather stupidly, I said yes.

W: We’ve all done it.

M: Anyway, from that point on, I was scared. What should I say? I decided to make notes during the lecture, and refer to interesting parts and thank her on behalf of the society. In fact, by the time Miss Bligh stood up to talk, I was feeling much better. But she was so nervous that kept forgetting what to say, and she spoke almost in a whiter. People at the back kept calling out “We can’t hear.” It was embarrassing!

W: I can imagine it.

M: At least the slides were good, that is, until the bulb in the projector blew. And she had to finish her talk with no illustrations.

W: So what did you say in your speech of thanks?

M: What can you say? You have to be polite. I mentioned the interesting facts, referred to the excellent slides, and then finished by saying "We’d all like to thank Miss Bligh for blowing out her slides.”【Q4】

W: Oh, no.

M: I felt terrible. I tried to apologize, not very successfully.

W: And the speech of thanks this evening?

M: I’ll write down exactly what I’m going to say and read it carefully.



女:比尔，今晚你要向演讲者做一个简短的致谢辞，是吗？

男:是的。

女:你似乎兴致不高。没那么糟糕，不是吗？

男:不，我不介意，真的。但我永远都忘不了我第一次做致谢辞的情景。

女:为什么？出什么事了吗？

男:嗯，当时我20出头，加入了当地的一个历史社团。

女:是吗？

男:反正，当时我和布兰奇小姐一起出席演讲。

女:噢，继续说。

男:她要用幻灯片讲述我们小镇在18世纪中期的历史。她刚出版了一本有关该主题的书籍，反响相当不错。于是，我去了。到了之后，秘书问我能否做一个致谢辞。我回答说好，相当之愚蠢。

女:我们都做过这种事。

男:反正，从那刻起，我开始担心起来。应该说什么呢？我决定听演讲时做笔记，援引演讲中有趣的内容，代表社团感谢她。实际上，到布兰奇小姐站起来开始演讲时，我感觉好多了。但是，她太紧张了，不停忘词，而且她演讲声音很小。后面的人不停地喊“我们听不见”。场面尴尬。

女:我能想象得到。

男:至少幻灯片不错，更确切地说，在投影仪的灯泡爆炸之前。然后她不得不继续完成她的演讲，却没有任何幻灯片展示。

女:那你致谢辞说的什么？

男:你能说什么？你必须彬彬有礼。我提到有趣的事实，说到那些非常棒的幻灯片。最后我说道：“我们都想感谢布兰奇小姐，吹爆了她的幻灯片。”

女:哦，不是吧。

男:我感觉糟透了。我试图道歉，但效果不太好。

女:今晚的致谢辞呢？

男:我将把要说的话一字不落地写下来，谨慎地读出来。

W: Well, our rivals are offering extended credit terms to some of the retailers in the area.【Q5】

M: Oh? Which rival is this? We only have two.

W: Barratts Company.

M: Oh, them. Well, they are hardly a threat.

W: I know they are smaller than us, but we can’t afford to ignore them.【Q6】

M: Yes, you are right, Laury. But I don’t like extended credit. It ties up cash we could put to better use elsewhere. But, I’ll look into it on Monday.

M: Don’t worry, Larny. I’m not crazy. I’ve been studying the possibility and I think we should give it ago.【Q8-2】

W: It’s not as easy as that though, is it? We’d have to reorganize the whole company.

M: Don’t be silly. I don’t intend starting next week. We’ll have to plan it properly. Of course, there will be a few problems...

W: A few problems? I can see hundreds. For one thing, transport. I have enough trouble delivering bikes to shops only 40 miles away, never mind 5,000 miles!

M: That’s what forwarding agents are for.

### Passage 1

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.



9.   A) It makes claims in conflict with the existing research.

B) It focuses on the link between bedtime and nutrition.

C) It cautions against the overuse of coffee and alcohol.

D) It shows that "night owls" work much less efficiently.



10.  A) They pay greater attention to food choice.

B) They tend to achieve less than their peers.

C) They run a higher risk of gaining weight.

D) They stand a greater chance to fall sick.



11.  A) Get up late.

B) Sleep 8 hours a day.

C) Exercise more.

D) Go to bed earlier.



A report on sleep and nutrition released this month found that people who consistently went to bed earlier than 11 p. m. took in fewer calories and ate more healthy food.【Q9】 In contrast, “night owls” who go to bed between 11 p. m. and 3 a. m. tend to consume more coffee, alcohol, refined sugars and processed meats than early risers.

This report corresponds with the existing scientific literature on bedtime and wellness. The relationship between getting more sleep and making better food choices is well-documented. A study published last year in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who sleep more tend to eat less unhealthy food than their peers who don’t get as much rest. And a 2015 study from the University of California, Berkeley, found that teens who go to bed late are more likely to gain weight over a five-year period.【Q10】

As a group, “night owl” types tend to eat less healthy food and take in more calories overall than early risers. The later one goes to bed, the more calories one records the next day. As yet a challenge to explain the cause-and-effect relationship between and nutrition, there may be a third factor that impacts both of them. Or the relationship could be reversed, that is, people who eat less fall asleep earlier. Still, if late sleepers want to lose a few pounds, they can go to bed earlier than they usually do, thereby, reducing their chances of taking snacks before bedtime.【Q11】



本月发布的一份有关睡眠和营养的报告显示，那些一直在晚上11点前睡觉的人摄入的卡路里更少，而且饮食更健康。相反，那些在晚上11点到3点之间睡觉的“夜猫子”比早起的人往往消费更多咖啡、酒精、精制糖和加工肉类。

这份报告与现行关于就寝时间和健康的科学文献相一致。获得更多睡眠和进行更好的食物选择之间的关系是有据可查的。去年在《美国临床营养学杂志》上发表的一项研究发现，睡得多的人比睡得少的同龄人往往吃得不健康的食物要少一些。加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校一项2015年的研究发现，晚睡的青少年在五年内体重更易增加。

作为一个群体，“夜猫子”型的人往往比早起的人吃的健康食品要少，摄入的卡路里也更多。睡得越晚，第二天有记录可查的卡路里摄入越多。尽管对睡眠和营业之间的因果关系进行解释仍存在挑战，但可能存在第三因素影响着他们。或者这种关系可以逆转，换言之，吃得少的人睡得更早。不过，晚睡的人想减重几磅，他们可以比往常睡得早一些，从而减少睡前吃零食的机会。



Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.

9.   What do we learn about the report released this month?

10.  What does the study from the University of California, Berkeley, find about teens who go to bed late?

11.  What should “night owls” do to reduce their consumption of unhealthy food?



9.从本月发布的报告中，我们能获取些什么信息？

A) 它提出的主张与现有研究相冲突。B) 它聚焦于睡眠与营养之间的联系。

C) 它警告不要过度使用咖啡和酒精。D) 它显示“夜猫子”工作效率更低。



10. 加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校有关晚睡的青少年的研究发现是什么？

A) 他们更加关注食物选择。B) 他们不如同龄人取得的成就大。

C) 他们增重的风险更高。D) 他们生病的机会更大。



11. “夜猫子”型应如何做以减少消费不健康食物？

A) 晚起。B) 每天8小时睡眠。

C) 做更多锻炼。D) 早睡。

### Passage 2



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.



12.  A) All of the acting nominees are white.

B) It has got too much publicity on TV.

C) It is prejudiced against foreign films.

D) Only 7% of the nominees are female.



13.  A) 22 percent of movie directors were people of color.

B) Half of the TV programs were ethnically balanced.

C) Only one-fifth of TV shows had black characters.

D) Only 3.4 percent of film directors were women.



14.  A) Non-white males.

B) Program creators.

C) Females of color over 40.

D) Asian speaking characters.



15.  A) They constitute 17% of Hollywood movie characters.

B) They are most underrepresented across TV and film.

C) They contribute little to the U. S. film industry.

D) They account for 8.5% of the U. S. population.



Researchers have found not just a diversity problem in Hollywood but actually an inclusion crisis.

With less than a week before an Oscars ceremony that has already been criticized for an all-white list of acting nominees【Q12】, a study shows the film industry does worse than television. Just 3.4 percent of film directors were female, and only 7 percent of films had a cast whose balance of race and ethnicity reflected the country’s diversity.【Q13】When researchers looked at all TV shows, they also found that women of color over 40 were regarded as “largely invisible” and just 22 percent of TV series creators were female.【Q14】

Overall, the study found half the films and TV shows had no Asian speaking characters and more than one-fifth of them had no black characters with dialogue. The film industry still functions as a straight, white, boy’s club. When looking at how women are depicted, the study found female characters were four times more likely to be shown in sexy clothing and nearly four times as likely to be referred to as physically attractive. But their results also indicated films and TV shows with women or people of color in the important jobs behind the scenes—director, producer or writer—tended to have better diversity numbers.

Across TV and film, the underrepresentation of non-white characters fails mostly on Hispanics.【Q15】Among more than 10,000 characters, proportions of white, black and Asian characters came close to U. S. population figures. But Hispanics were just 5.8 percent of characters, despite being about 17 percent of the U.S. population.



研究人员发现好莱坞存在的不只是一个多样性问题，实际上是一个包容危机。

在奥斯卡颁奖典礼开始前不到一周，因为一份全是白人提名的演员名单而被批评，某研究表明电影业比电视更糟糕。电影导演中只有3.4%为女性，而且仅有7%的电影演员阵容做到了人种和民族的平衡，反映出国家的多样性。研究人员在查看所有的电视节目之后，他们还发现年过40的有色人种女性被认为是“在很大程度上无足轻重”，而且仅有22%的电视剧创作者为女性。

总体而言，该研究发现，一半的电影和电视节目没有说亚洲语种的角色，超过五分之一的电影和电视节目没有有对话台词的黑人角色。电影业仍充当着白种直男俱乐部的角色。当该研究在研究电影和电视节目如何刻画女性形象时发现，穿着性感服装的女性角色要比男性角色高出4倍，被称作身体吸引的可能性也差不多高出4倍。但它们的结果也表明，女性和有色人种从事导演、制作人或编剧等幕后重要工作的电影和电视节目往往更具有更好的多样性指数。

在电视和电影中，非白人角色的表现不足主要体现在西班牙裔。在10000多个角色中，白人、黑人和亚裔角色的比例差不多接近美国人口数据。尽管西班牙裔占到17%的美国人口，但其角色比例仅占5.8%。



Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.

12.  Why has the Oscars ceremony been criticized?

13.  What do we learn from the research?

14.  Who are regarded as “largely invisible” on TV shows?

15.  What does the speaker say about Hispanics?



12. 人们为何批评奥斯卡颁奖典礼？

A)所有表演提名全是白人。B）在电视上宣传过多。

C）歧视外国电影。D）只有7%的提名者为女性。



13. 从研究中我们了解到什么？

A) 22%的电影导演为有色人种。B）一半的电视节目的种族均衡。

C）只有五分之一的电视节目有黑人角色。D）只有3.4%的电影导演是女性。



14. 谁在电视节目中被认为是“在很大程度上无足轻重”？

A) 非白人男性。B）节目创作者。

C) 年过40的女性有色人种。D）讲亚洲语种的角色。



15. 关于西班牙裔，讲话者说了些什么？

### Recording 1



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.



16.  A) One that can provide for emergency needs.

B) One that can pay for their medical expenses.

C) One that covers their debts and burial expenses.

D) One that ensures a healthy life for their later years.



17.  A) Purchase insurance for their children.

B) Save sufficient money for a rainy day.

C) Buy a home with a small down payment.

D) Add more insurance on the breadwinner.



18.  A) When their children grow up and leave home.

B) When they have saved enough for retirement.

C) When their family move to a different place.

D) When they have found better-paying jobs.



When purchasing life insurance, there are many important factors to consider. One should buy the policies that give the most protection at the least cost, ensure the right family members, and consider the family’s financial needs. It is important to buy the insurance from companies that are financially sound and that are represented by honest, well-trained agents. At various stages in a person’s life, different kinds of life insurance are needed for particular situations.

Jerry is single and has no dependents. Probably the only life insurance he needs is enough to cover his debts and burial expenses.【Q16】Insurance can be purchased at a lower rate during the young years, but by buying while young, the premiums are paid in for a longer period of time. In the end, the amount paid for premiums is about the same. A person shouldn’t buy insurance protection that really isn’t necessary. Suppose that Jerry marries Jeannette, who is a college graduate and is working. Perhaps enough insurance would be needed to cover their debts and burial expenses. Now, Jeannette has quit work and their first child is on the way. They have purchased a home with a small down payment and a 30-year mortgage. The situation regarding life insurance takes on a different look. There are dependents who need financial protection. How much insurance is needed? As the family increases in size, it is essential to add more insurance on the breadwinner to protect the dependents.【Q17】When the children are young and depend upon the family for financial needs，families with modest incomes have difficulty providing enough life insurance to protect the mother and the children. Families with modest incomes should insure the breadwinner or breadwinners first. When considering the amount of insurance for the mother with dependent children’ substitute child care is a need that should be planned for until the children can care for themselves. The death of a small child would have no effect upon the income of the family. Perils a policy to meet funeral expenses would be sufficient for the young child, although most people do not take out insurance on their young children. As the children become financially Independent of the family, the emphasis on family financial security will shift from protection to saving for the retirement years.【Q18】 Every family situation is different, but it is important that each family give adequate thought to planning its financial future.



在购买寿险时，有很多重要因素需要考虑。应购买那些以最少的成本给予最大保障的险单，确保覆盖合适的家庭成员，而且要考虑家庭的财政需求。重要的是，从财务健全且有诚实、训练有素的代理代表的保险公司那里购买保险。在人一生的各个阶段，特定情况下需要不同种类的寿险。

杰瑞单身，且没有家眷。他可能需要的唯一寿险就是足以支付他的债务和丧葬费用的保险。在年轻时能以较低的价格购买保险，但保险费支付的时间较长。最终，支付的保险费总额都差不多。真的不必要购买保险保障。假设杰瑞与珍妮特结婚。珍妮特拥有大学文凭，有自己的工作。也许需要支付的保险费用足够支付他们的债务和丧葬费用。现在，珍妮特辞职了，他们的第一个孩子将要出生。他们购买了一套小额首付的房子，30年按揭。寿险的情况呈现出不同的面貌。出现了需要财务保障的家属。需要多少钱的保险呢？随着家庭成员的增多，为负担生计的人增加保额，保护受抚养者是很重要的。当孩子们年幼，依赖家庭提供经济支持，收入微薄的家庭很难提供足够的寿险来保护母亲和孩子。收入微薄的家庭应首先保证养家糊口的那个人或几个人。在考虑给需要抚养孩子的母亲投保时，替代性照料是一项需要规划的事项，直至孩子能照顾他们自己为止。小孩的死亡对家庭收入没有影响。尽管大多数人没有为他们年幼的孩子购买保险，但或许能支付丧葬费用的保单对年幼的儿童可能也就足够了。当孩子们经济独立之后，家庭经济保障的重点将转变为退休后的保障。每个家庭的情况不同，但重要的是，每个家庭都充分考虑规划它们的财务前景。



Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording yon have just heard.

16.  What life insurance should a single person buy, according to the speaker?

17.  What should people do as their family increases in size?

18.  When should one change their life insurance?



16. 根据讲话者，单身的人应购买怎样的寿险？

A) 能提供紧急需要的保险。B) 能支付他们医疗费用的保险。

C) 支付他们债务和丧葬费用的保险。D) 保证晚年健康生活的保险。



17. 随着家庭成员的增加，人们应做什么？

A) 为他们的子女购买保险。B) 存储足够的钱以备不时之需。

C) 小额首付款购买房子。D) 增加负担生计的人的保额。



18. 某个人什么时候应变更他们的寿险？

A) 当他们的子女长大成人，并且离开了家。 B) 当他们存够了退休的钱。

C) 当他们的家庭搬迁到另一处不同的地方。D) 当他们找到薪资更高的工作。

D) A negative stereotype sticks while a positive one does not.





“Stereotype” may sound like a bad word, but there’s nothing bad about it. For one thing, stereotypes are often accurate【Q19】.When you ask people about their concept of stereotypes, they get it pretty much right Also, stereotypes are often positive, particularly of groups that we ourselves belong to. Some of the statistical generalizations may be positive as some groups have reputations for being smart, for being loyal, for being brave, for all sorts of things that are not at all negative. And so there’s nothing inherently wrong about stereotypes.

But there are problems with stereotypes. For one thing, they’re reliable insofar as they’re based on unbiased samples. But a lot of the information we get about human groups is through biased sources like how they’re represented in the media. And if these sources don’t give you an accurate depiction, your stereotype won’t be accurate.【Q20】

For example, many Jews have ble6n troubled by Shakespeare’s depiction of Shylock. If the only Jew you know is Shakespeare’s Shylock, it’s going to be a very bad impression. So one problem with stereotypes is while we are good at drawing conclusions from them, often our information isn’t reliable.

A second problem is that stereotypes, regardless of whether or not they’re accurate, can have a negative effect on the people that they apply to.【Q21】 And this is what psychologist, Claude Steele, described as stereotype threat. He has a vivid example of this. Here’s how to make African-Americans do worse on a math test. You have the test and you put on the test that they have to identify their race. The very act of acknowledging that they sire African-Americans when given a test ignites in them thoughts of their own stereotype which is negative regarding academics and that makes them do worse. Want to know how to make a woman do worse on a math test? Same thing, get her to write down her sex.

One recent study found a sort of clever twist on this. When Asian-American women are given a test and they’re asked to mark down their race, they do better than they would otherwise do. They’re reminded of a positive stereotype that boosts their morale.【Q22】 You ask them，on the other hand, to mark down their sex, they do worse because they’re reminded of a negative stereotype. That’s an example of how stereotypes have a potentially damaging effect on people.



“固有印象”可能听起来像一个贬义词，但它并没有什么不好的。首先，固有印象常常是准确的。当我们询问人们对固有印象的概念时，他们说得大部分都对。此外，固有印象常常是积极的，尤其是我们所属的集体。一些统计概括可能是积极的，因为某些团体以聪明、忠诚、勇敢、所有并非完全负面的东西而闻名。因此，固有印象原本并没有什么不对。

但固有印象也存在问题。首先，只要它们基于无偏样本，它们就是可靠的。但我们获取的许多有关人类群体的信息都是存在偏见的来源，如它们在媒体中的呈现。而且如果这些来源没有给予你准确的描述，你的固有印象就不会正确。

例如，许多犹太人都被莎士比亚笔下刻画的夏洛克形象所困扰。假如你唯一认识的犹太人是莎士比亚笔下的夏洛克的话，这将是非常坏的印象。因此，固有印象的一个问题是，虽然我们擅长从中得出结论，但我们的信息并不可靠。

第二个问题是，无论固有印象准确与否，固有印象会对它们所适用的人产生负面影响。这就是心理学家克劳德·斯蒂尔所描述的固有印象的威胁。他列举了一个生动的例子。下面是如何让非裔美国人在数学测试中做得更糟糕的例子。你举行一次测试，在测试时让他们必须确认他们的种族。正是这种承认他们是非裔美国人的行为，在测试时引发了他们对自己在学术方面的负面评价的想法，而且这使得他们变得更糟糕。想知道如何让女性在数学测试中做得更糟糕吗？同样的事，让她们写下自己的性别。

最近一项研究发现，这出现了某种巧妙的转折。当亚裔美国女性参加测试，被要求写下她们的种族时，她们比原本做得更好。她们想起了一个积极的固有印象，鼓舞了她们的士气。另一方面，你要求她们写下自己的性别，因为她们想起了一种负面的固有印象，她们就做得更糟糕。这就是固有印象对人们造成潜在破坏性影响的一个事例。

Sometimes when you take a common drug, you may have a side effect. That is，the drug may cause some effect other than its intended one. When these side effects occur, they are called adverse reactions. Whenever you have an adverse reaction, you should stop taking the drug right away.【Q23】 Ask your pharmacist whether he can suggest a drug that will relieve the symptoms but that will not cause the adverse reaction. If an adverse reaction to a drug is serious, consult your doctor for advice at once.

Drugs that are safe in the dosage stated on the label may be very dangerous in large doses. For example, aspirin is seldom thought of as dangerous, but there are many reports of accidental poisoning of young children who take too many aspirin pills as well as the possible development of Reye syndrome in children with flu. In adults，excessive use of some pain-killing drugs may cause severe kidney damage. Some drugs for relief of stomach insets，when taken in excess，can perhaps cause serious digestive problems. You should never use any over-the-counter drug on a regular, continued basis, or in large quantities, except on your doctor’s advice. You could be suffering from a serious illness that needs a doctor’s care.

Each drug you take not only acts on the body but may also alter the effect of any other drug you are taking. Sometimes this can cause dangerous or even fatal reactions. For example, aspirin increases the blood- thinning effects of drugs given to patients with heart disease. Therefore, a patient who has been taking such a drug may risk bleeding if he or she uses aspirin for a headache. Before using several drugs together you should ask your doctor and follow his advice. Your pharmacist can tell you whether certain drugs can safely be taken together.

Alcohol may increase the effect of a drug【Q24】—sleeping pills combine with alcohol to produce a sleepy feeling. When taking any drug, you should ask your doctor whether drinking alcohol could be dangerous in combination with the medicine.

Experts believe there is a relationship between adult abuse of legitimate medicines and the drug culture that has swept our country. You can do your share to reduce the chances that your children will become part of the drug culture by treating all medicines with respect.【Q25】Always let your children know that medicines and drugs should not be used carelessly.



有时你服用普通药时，可能会产生副作用。换言之，药物会产生一些非预期的效果。当这些副作用发生时，我们将其称之为不良反应。无论何时产生不良反应，都应立即停止服药。问问你的药剂师是否能推荐一种可以缓解症状，但不会引起不良反应的药物。如果对药物的不良反应严重，应立即咨询医生。

在标签上注明剂量安全范围内的药物大剂量使用可能会非常危险。例如，阿司匹林很少被认为是危险的，但也有年幼儿童吞服了大量阿司匹林药片意外中毒以及患流感的儿童发展成为雷氏综合症的大量报告。对于成年人而言，过度使用一些止痛药可能会导致肾脏严重损害。一些用于缓解胃部不适的药物，如果过量服用，可能会导致严重的消化问题。除非医生建议，否则你绝不应经常、连续或大量使用任何非处方药物。你可能患了重病，需要医生的照顾。

你服用的每种药不仅会对身体起作用，而且还可能改变你所服用的任何其他药物的效果。有时这会导致危险甚至致命的反应。例如，阿司匹林会增加心脏病患者所吞服药物的血液稀释作用。因此，服用这种药物的病人如果使用阿司匹林治疗头痛，可能会有出血的危险。在同时使用几种药物之前，应先问问你的医生并听从他的建议。你的药剂师能告诉你某些药物是否可以一起安全地使用。

酒精会增强某些药物的药效——安眠药与酒精配合会产生困倦感。当服用任何药物时，应问问你的医生，用药期间饮酒是否有危险。

专家认为，成人滥用合法药物与席卷我国的毒品文化之间存在着某种联系。你可以尽自己的一份力量，对所有药物心存敬畏，从而减少让你的孩子沦为毒品文化一部分的机会。一定要让你的孩子知道不应随便使用药品和毒品。
