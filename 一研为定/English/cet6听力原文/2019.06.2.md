1. A) Why *Roman Holiday* was more famous than *Breakfast at Tiffany's*.

B) Why Audrey Hepburn had more female fans than male ones.

C) Why the woman wanted to be like Audrey Hepburn.

D) Why so many girls adored Audrey Hepburn.



2. A) Her unique personality.

B) Her physical condition.

D) Her family's suspension of financial aid.



3. A) She was not an outgoing person.

B) She was easy-going on the whole.

C) She was modest and hardworking.

D) She was usually not very optimistic.



4. A) She was influenced by the roles she played in the films.

B) Her parents taught her to sympathize with the needy.

C) She learned to volunteer when she was a child.

D) Her family benefited from other people's help.





W: Wow! I would give anything to be more like Audrey Hepburn!

M: [1]I never really understood why so many girls were such big fans of her. I mean I've seen the famous films, *Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany's*, and a few others, but I still don't fully get it. Was she that great of an actress?

W: Well, for me, my adoration goes beyond her movies. She had such a classic elegance about her. She was always so poised, in part because she spent years training as a ballet dancer before be-coming an actress.

M: Why didn't she stick to dancing as a career?

W: It seems it was fate.[2] She suffered from inadequate nutrition during the war, and therefore a career as a professional dancer would have been too demanding on her body. So she focused on acting instead. *Roman Holiday* was her first big break which made her a star.

M: Was that the film that opened with her shopping for jewelry in New York city, you know, the scene she was wearing a black dress and dark sunglasses with a pearl necklace and long black gloves? I see the photo of her in that costume everywhere.

W: No, that one is *Breakfast at Tiffany's*. That costume is often referred to as the most famous little black dress of all time. [3] Her character in that film is very outgoing and charming, even though in real life Audrey always described herself as shy and quiet.

M: So what did she do after her acting career?

W: [4] She dedicated much of her life to helping children in need. Her family received international aid during the war when she was growing up. I think that left a big impression on her. That's where I got the idea to volunteer for children's charity next weekend.

M: I'll join you. I may not be as charming as Audrey Hepburn, but I'm all for supporting a good cause.



**Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.**

女：哇！为了更像奥黛丽·赫本，我愿意付出一切！

男：我真搞不懂为什么那么多女孩都那么喜欢她。我的意思是，我看过一些著名的电影，《罗马假日》、《蒂凡尼的早餐》和一些其他的，但我还是没完全明白。作为一个演员，她有那么了不起吗？

女：对我来说，我对她的崇拜不只是因为电影。她有一种古典的优雅气质。她总是那么泰然自若，一部分原因是在成为演员之前，她曾接受过多年的芭蕾舞训练。

男：她为什么不坚持以跳舞为职业呢？

女：似乎是命运使然。在战争期间她营养不足，作为一名职业舞蹈演员对身体要求太高。所以她转而专注于表演。《罗马假日》是她的第一个重大突破，使她成为明星。

男：是那部在影片开头她在纽约买珠宝的电影吗？那个场景她穿着黑色的裙子，戴着深色的太阳镜、珍珠项链和黑色的长手套。到处都能看到她那张照片。

女：不，那个是《蒂美尼的早餐》。那套服装常被称为有史以来最著名的小黑裙。尽管在现实生活中奥黛丽总是说自己害羞而安静，但她在那电影中角色非常向、迷人。

男：那她在演艺生涯结束后做了什么？

女：她一生大部分时间都致力于帮助有困难儿童。在她成长的过程中，她的家人在战争期间接受了国际援助。我想这给她留下了深刻的印象。我就是因此萌生了下周末去儿童慈善机构做志愿者的想法。

男：我和你一起去。我可能没有奥黛丽·赫本那么迷人，但我非常支持这么美好的事业。

W: Yes, there is already a feeling that this is a top-down change. We really need to get everyone on board.

M: Well, there's been an extensive consultation period.

W: I know, but there's always the feeling that if it isn't broke, don't fix it.

M: People are worried about their jobs, too. [6] I think we need to stress that while there will be some job changes, there won't be anyone getting dismissed. In fact, we're looking to take on more staff.

W: Agreed. You can hardly blame people for worrying though. We need to make it clear that it' snot just change for change's sake. In other words, we really must make the case for why we're doing it. So, what's the outline of the presentation?

M: [7] I'll start with a brief review of the reasons for the change that we really need to make a clean break to restart growth. After that, I'll outline the new company structures and who's going where. Then I'll hand it over to you to discuss the timeline and summarize. And we will take questions together at the end. Anything else?

W: Oh, yeah. We should let the staff know the channels of communication, you know, who they can contact or direct questions to about these changes.

M: Yes. And we can collect some frequently asked questions and present some general answers.

W:[8] Mm, and we will make the presentation and questions available via the company's own computer network, right?

M: Yes. We'll make a page on the network where staff can download all the details.

W: All right. Perhaps we should do a practice run of the presentation first.

### Passage 1



**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**



9. A) It helps passengers to take care of their pet animals.

B) It has animals to help passengers carry their luggage.

C) It uses therapy animals to soothe nervous passengers.

D) It allows passengers to have animals travel with them.



10. A) Avoiding possible dangers.

B) Finding their way around.

C) Identifying drug smugglers.

D) Looking after sick passengers.



11. A) Schedule their flights around the animal visits.

B) Photograph the therapy animals at the airport.

C) Keep some animals for therapeutic purposes.

D) Bring their pet animals on board their plane.









Airline passengers have to deal with a lot these days; getting bumped from flights and losing luggage on top of the general anxiety that nervous passengers always feel. [9] At the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, miniature horses deliver a calming force two times a month. Denver and Ruby are two of the 34 therapy horses brought in from a local farm. They can usually be found in the ticket counter area interacting with travelers. More than 30 airports across the country now have therapy dogs. San Francisco has a therapy pig. San Jose, California, began a dog program after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Since its beginning, the program has now grown and has 21 therapy dogs and a therapy cat. The animals don't get startled. They have had hundreds of hours of airport training so they are used to having luggage and people crowding around them. [10]These professional animals are probably better at finding their way in the airports than the most frequent of travelers. The passengers often say that seeing animals makes them feel much better and helps them to calm down before a flight. This little bit of support can sometimes make a big difference. [11] Some passengers enjoy the animals so much that they call the airport to schedule flights around their visits. Visits to nursing homes and schools are also a regular part of the horses' schedule. Their owner is already working on a new idea for a therapy animal—donkeys.



**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

9. What is special about the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport？

10. What are the trained animals probably capable of doing in an airport？

11. What do some passengers try to do？





最近航空乘客要处理很多事情，换航班，紧张的乘客通常会感到焦虑，在焦虑时又丢失行李。在辛那提和北肯塔基国际机场，小型马每月出现两次，让紧张的乘客感到平静。从当地农场引进了34匹治疗马，丹芙和鲁比就是其中的两只。他们经常在售票区与旅客互动。全国30多个机场现在都有治疗犬。旧金山有一只治疗猪。911恐怖袭击发生后，加利福尼亚州圣何塞市开始了一项养狗计划。项目开始后，已经逐步发展，现在有21只治疗犬和一只治疗猫。动物们不会被吓到。他们在机场接受了数百小时的培训，所以它们已经习惯了被行李和拥挤的人群包围着。在机场，这些专业的动物可能比最常去的旅客更熟悉路。乘客们经常说，一看到就感觉好多了，动物帮助他们在飞机起飞前冷静下来。这种小小的帮助有时会产生很大的影响。有些乘客非常喜欢这些动物，他们打电话到机场来，根据动物们的行程安排航班。参观疗养院和学校也是马儿们日常行程的一部分。他们的主人已经在研究一种新的治疗动物——驴。



9. 在辛辛那提和北肯塔基国际机场有什么特别之处？

A）帮助乘客照顾宠物。

B）让动物帮乘客拿行李。

C）用治疗动物帮助紧张的乘客缓和情绪。

C) At the site of an ancient Roman mansion.

D) At the entrance to a reception hall in Rome.



13. A) A number of different images.

15. A) His artistic taste is superb.

B) His identity remains unclear.

C) He was a collector of antiques.

D) He was a rich Italian merchant.





Hello, viewers. [12] Today I'm standing at a 2,000-year-old Roman-era site. Here, the brightly colored scenes that once decorated a mansion are being dug up. These scenes are turning up in the southern French city of Arles, surprising the historians who have been working here since 2014. Patches of paint still cling to the stone walls of a bedroom and reception hall, some of these painted walls are preserved in places to a height of one meter. In addition, thousands of fragments that fell off the walls have been recovered. [13] These pieces have been put back together with great care and display a variety of images. Some of these images include figures never seen before in France, such as a woman playing a stringed instrument, possibly a character from mythology.

 [14] The paintings were done with such skill and with such expensive dyes that experts believe the artists originally came from Italy. [15] They were likely hired by one of the city's elite. Perhaps a Roman official wanted Pompeii-like interior to remind him of home. He was probably stationed in this provincial trading port, founded in 46 BC as a colony for veterans of the Roman army. [15] Or maybe a wealthy local wanted to show off his worldly sophistication. The paintings may yield even more stunning surprises as additional sections are put together like pieces of a puzzle. Whoever it was that created such magnificent pieces of art, they surely had no idea that their work would still be around thousands of years later.



**Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

12. Where is the speaker standing?

13.What do the thousands of fragments display when they are put back together？

14.What makes experts think the paintings were done by artists from Italy？

15.What do we learn from the passage about the owner of the mansion？





游客朋友们大家好。今天我站在一个有着2000年历史的罗马时代遗址上。在这里，一座大宅院的色彩鲜艳的画作正在被挖掘。这些作品出现在法国南部城市阿尔勒让自2014年以来一直在这里工作的历史学家感到惊讶。卧室和接待大厅的石墙上还残留着一片片油漆，有些漆墙被保存在一米高的地方。此外，数千块从墙上掉下来的碎片已经被找到。这些碎片被小心翼翼地重新组装在一起，展示出各种各样的图像。其中一些图像包括画着在法国从未见过的人物，比如弹奏弦乐器的女人，可能是神话中的角色。

这些画技巧非常高超，颜料也很昂贵，所以专家们认为这些画家最初来自意大利。它们可能是被这个城市的一位上层人士租用的。也许是一位罗马官员，他喜欢庞培式的内部装饰，因为这让他想起家乡。他可能驻扎在省级贸易港口，这个港口建于公元前46年，是罗马退伍军人的居住区。又或者是一个当地的有钱人想要炫耀自己的老练世故。随着更多的碎片像拼图一样拼在一起，这些画可能会展现出更令人惊叹的日出景象。无论是谁创作了如此壮丽的艺术作品，他们肯定不知道自己的作品在几千年后仍然存在。



12. 说话者站在哪里？

A）在阿尔勒的一面美丽的壁画墙边。

B）在一个罗马城市的大门旁边。

C）在一座古罗马宅院。

D）在罗马接待大厅的入口处。

【答案】C



13.数千块碎片被拼在一起时展现出什么？

A）许多不同的图像。

B）许多神话英雄。

C）各种音乐器材。

D）法国著名艺术家的画作。

【答案】A



14.是什么让专家觉得这些画来自意大利的艺术家？

A）独特的构思和专业的技巧。

B）画作展示出的老练世故。

C）令人惊叹的生动的图像。

D）高超的技巧和昂贵的颜料。

【答案】D



15.关于这座宅院的主人，从文章中能知道什么？

A）他的艺术品味很高。

B）他的身份还不确定。

C）他是一位古董收藏家。

### Recording 1



**Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

16. A) They encourage international cooperation.

B) They lay stress on basic scientific research.

C) They place great emphasis on empirical studies.

D) They favour scientists from its member countries.



17. A) Many of them wish to win international recognition.

B) They believe that more hands will make light work.

C) They want to follow closely the international trend.

D) Many of their projects have become complicated.



18. A) It requires mathematicians to work independently.

B) It is faced with many unprecedented challenges.

C) It lags behind other disciplines in collaboration.

D) It calls for more research funding to catch up.









Good afternoon, class. Today I want to discuss with you a new approach to empirical research. In the past, scientists often work to learn. They were confined to the university or research center where they worked. Today, though, we are seeing mergers of some of the greatest scientific minds regardless of their location. [16]There has never been a better time for collaborations with foreign scientists. In fact, the European Union is taking the lead. Spurred on by funding policies half of European research articles had international co-authors in 2007. This is more than twice the level of two decades ago. The European Union's level of international co-authorship is about twice that of the United States, Japan and India. Even so, the levels in these countries are also rising. This is a sign of the continued allure of creating scientific coalitions across borders. Andrew Schubert, a researcher at the Institute for Science Policy Research, says that the rise in collaboration is partly out of necessity. [17] This necessity comes with the rise of "big science." Many scientific endeavors have become more complicated. These new complications require the money and labor of many nations.But he says collaborations have also emerged because of increased possibilities; the Internet allows like-minded scientists to find each other. Simultaneously, dramatic drops in communication costs ease long-disance interactions. And there is a reward: studies of citation counts show that internationally co-authored papers have better visibility. Schubert says international collaboration is a way to spread ideas in wider and wider circles. Caroline Wagner, a research scientist at George Washington University, notes that international collaborations offer additional flexibility. Whereas local collaborations sometimes persist past the point of usefulness because of social or academic obligations, international ones can be cultivated and dropped more freely. The collaborative trend is true across scientific disciplines. Some fields, though, have a greater tendency for it. Particle physicists and astronomers collaborate often. This is because they must share expensive facilities. [18] Mathematicians, by contrast tend historically towards solitude. As a consequence, they lag behind other disciplines. However, Wagner says partnerships are rising there too. The level of collaboration also varies from country to country." There are historical and political reasons as to why collaborations emerge," says Wagner. This rise is also apparently boosted by policies embedded in European framework funding schemes. These policies underlie funding requirements that often require teamwork.



**Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

16. What do we learn about the research funding policies in the European Union？

17. Why do researchers today favour international collaboration？

18. What do we learn about the field of mathematics？





下午好，同学们。今天我想和你们讨论一种新的实证研究方法。在过去，科学家们经常在工作中学习。他们只能在他们工作的大学或研究中心工作。然而，今天，我们见证了一些最伟大的科学家们，不管处在何地，都在一起进行合作。目前是与外国科学家合作的最好时机了。事实上，欧盟正在做领头羊。在资助政策的推动下，2007年，欧洲有一半的研究文章都有国际合著者，这是20年前的两倍多。欧盟的国际合著水平是美国、日本和印度的两倍。即便如此，这些国家的水平也在上升。这是建立跨国界科学联盟的持续吸引力的标志。科学政策研究所的研究员安德鲁·舒伯特说，合作增长有一部分是出于必要性。这一必要性源于“大科学”的兴起，许多科学工作变得更加复杂。这些新的复杂情况需要许多国家的财力和劳动力。但他说，合作也因为可能性的加大而出现；互联网允许志同道合的科学家找到彼此。同时，通信成本的大幅下降缓解了远程交互。还有一个奖赏：对引用数量的研究表明，国际合著的论文具有更好的可见性。舒伯特说，国际合作是一种在更广泛的领域传播思想的方式。乔治·华盛顿大学的研究科学家卡罗琳·瓦格纳有时候会坚持有用性这一点，因为国际上的社会或学术上的义务很容易受到培养，也很容易遭到抛弃。跨科学学科的协作趋势是确实的。不过，有些领域的发展趋势更明显。粒子物理学家和天文学家经常合作。这是因为他们必须共享昂贵的设施。相比之下，有史以来数学家倾向于独立研究。因此，他们落后于其他学科。然而，瓦格纳斯说，伙伴关系也在上升。各国的合作水平各不相同。瓦格纳说：“合作出现，有历史原因，也有政治原因。”欧洲框架融资计划中的政策显然也推动了这一增长。这些政策是经常需要团队合作的资金需求的基础。



16.对于欧盟的研究资助政策，我们了解多少？

A）他们鼓励国际合作。

B）他们注重基础科学研究。

C）他们非常重视实证研究。

D）他们支持其成员国的科学家。

【答案】A



17.为什么今天的研究人员倾向于国际合作？

A）他们中的许多人希望赢得国际认可。

B）他们希望人手更多能够使工作变轻松。

C）他们希望密切关注国际趋势。

D）他们的很多项目变得复杂起来。

【答案】D



18.对于数学领域，我们了解多少？

A）它要求数学家独立工作。

C）它在协作方面落后于其他学科。

B）它面临着很多前所未有的挑战。

D）它需要更多的研究经费来弥补。

【答案】C

### Recording 2



**Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

19. A) Scientists tried to send a balloon to Venus.

B) Scientists discovered water on Venus.

C) Scientists found Venus had atmosphere.

D) Scientists observed Venus from a space vehicle



20. A) It resembles Earth in many aspects.

B) It is the same as fiction has portrayed.

C) It is a paradise of romance for alien life.

D) It undergoes geological changes like Earth.



21. A) It might have been hotter than it is today.

B) It might have been a cozy habitat for life.

C) It used to have more water than Earth.

D) It used to be covered with rainforests.







Good evening. In 1959, on the day that I was born, a headline in*Life* magazine proclaimed

"Target Venus: There May be Life There! [19] It told of how scientists rode a balloon to an altitude of 80,000 feet to make telescope observations of Venus's atmosphere, and how their discovery of water raised hopes that there could be living things there. As a kid I thrilled to tales of adventure in Isaac Asimov's juvenile science-fiction novel *Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus*.

For many of my peers, though, Venus quickly lost its romance. The very first thing that scientists discovered with a mission to another planet was that Venus was not at all the earthly paradise that fiction had portrayed. [20] It is nearly identical to our own planet in bulk properties such as mass density, and size. But its surface has been cooked and dried by an ocean of carbon dioxide. Trapped in the burning death-grip of a runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has long been held up as a cautionary tale for everything that could go wrong on a planet like Earth. As a possible home for alien life, it has been voted the planet least likely to succeed.

But I have refused to give up on Venus, and over the years my stubborn loyalty has been justified. The rocky views glimpsed by Venera 9 and other Russian landers suggested a tortured volcanic history. That was confirmed in the early 1990s by the American Magellan orbiter, which used radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds and map out a rich, varied, and dynamic surface. The surface formed mostly in the last billion years, which makes it fresher and more recently active than any rocky planet other than Earth. [21] Russian and American spacecraft also found hints that its ancient climate might have been wetter, cooler, and possibly even friendly to life. Measurements of density and composition imply that Venus originally formed out of basically the same stuff as Earth. That presumably included much more water than the tiny trace we find blowing in the thick air today.

Thus our picture of Venus at around the time life was getting started on Earth is one of warm oceans, probably rich with organic molecules, splashing around rocky shores and volcanic vents. The sun was considerably less bright back then. So, Venus was arguably a cozier habitat for life than Earth.



**Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

19. What do we learn from the *Life* magazine article?

20. What are scientists' findings about Venus?

21. What information did Russian and American space probes provide about Venus?





晚上好。1959年，我出生的那天，《生活》杂志上的一条标题宣称“目标金星：那里可能有生命！”它讲述了科学家如何乘坐气球到8万英尺的高度，用望远镜观察金星的大气层，以及他们对水的发是如何燃起了对火星上存在生物的希望。小时候，我对艾萨克·阿西莫夫的少年科幻小说《幸运斯塔》和《金星海洋》中的冒险故事感到兴奋。

但对我的许多同龄人来说，金星很快就失去了浪漫。科学家们在前往另一个星球的任务中发现的第一件事就是金星根本不是小说所描绘的像地球一样的天堂。它在质量、密度和大小等体积性质上几乎与地球相同。但是它的表面已经被海量的二氧化碳蒸发了。长期以来，金星一直被困在失控的温室效应的熊熊烈焰中，被认为是一个警告性的故事，提醒我们在地球这样的星球上，任何有可能的事情都可能发生。就外星生命存在的可能性而言，它被选为了最不可能的一个星球。

但我拒绝放弃金星，多年来我执拗的忠诚得到了正名。韦涅拉9号和其他俄罗斯的探测器所看到的岩石景观暗示了一段曲折的火山历史。20世纪90年代初，美国麦哲伦号金星探测器证实了这一点，它利用雷达探测地球上厚厚的云层，并绘制出一个丰富、多样、动态的表面。地球表面的形成主要是在过去的十亿年里，这使得它比地球以外的任何岩石行星都新、都活跃。俄罗斯和美国的太空探测器也发现了一些迹象，表明火星古时候的气候可能比现在更湿润、更凉爽，甚至比现在更适合生物生存。对密度和成分的测量表明金星最初是由与地球基本相同的物质组成的。据推测，比我们今天在浓密的空气中发现的水更多。

因此，在生命开始在地球上出现的时候，那时金星是一个温暖的海洋，岩石海岸和火山口周围可能富含有机分子。那时太阳还没有现在这么亮。因此，那时的金星可以说是比地球更舒适的生命家园。



19.我们能从《生活》杂志了解到什么？

A）科学家们试图把一个气球送到金星。

B）科学家们在金星上发现了水。

C）科学家们发现金星有大气层

D）科学家从一个宇宙飞船上观察到金星。

【答案】B



20.关于金星，科学家们有什么发现？

A）它在很多方面和地球很像。

B）它和小说描述的一样。

C）它是外星生命的浪漫天堂。

D）它像地球一样经历着地质变化。

【答案】A



21.俄罗斯和美国的太空探测器提供了哪些关于金星的信息？

A）它可能比今天还热。

B）它曾经可能是一个舒适的生命家园。

C）它过去的水比地球多。

D）它曾经被雨林覆盖。

【答案】B

I'm a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia. [22] I specialize in cultural psychology examining similarities and differences between East Asians and North Americans. Our research team has been looking at cultural differences in self-enhancing motivations, how people have positive feelings towards not only themselves but things connected to themselves. For example, when you own something, you view it as more valuable than when you don't own it. It's called the “endowment effect”The strength of that effect is stronger in Western cultures than in East Asian cultures. So we've been looking at other ways of seeing whether this motivation to view oneself positively is shaped by cultural experiences.

We've also started to look at how culture shapes sleep. [23] We' re still in the exploratory stages of this project—although what's noteworthy is that East Asians on average sleep about an hour and a half less each night than North Americans do. And it's not a more efficient sleep, not like they're compressing relatively more value out of their hours. Other studies have found that even infants in East Asia sleep about an hour less than European infants. So we're trying to figure out how culture shapes the way you sleep.

 [24] Our experiment does not take place in a sleep lab. Instead we lend people motion-detecting watches and they wear them for a week at a time-whenever they're not having a shower or swimming, they keep it on. These kinds of watches are used in sleep studies as a way of measuring how long people are sleeping, how efficient their sleep is, and whether they're waking up in the night. Ideally I'd like to take this into a controlled lab environment. We'll see where the research points us. We usually start off with the more affordable methods, and if everything looks promising, then it'll justify trying to build a sleep lab and study sleep across cultures that way.

Why do we study sleep? [25] Sleep is something that has really been an unexplored topic cross-culturally. I'm attracted to it because culture isn't something that only shapes the way our minds operate; it shapes the way our bodies operate too, and sleep is at the intersection of those.

我是不列颠哥伦比亚大学的心理学教授。我主要研究文化心理学，对比东亚人和北美人之间的异同。我们的研究团队一直在研究自我提升动机方面的文化差异，人们怎样既对自己有积极的感觉，又对与自己相关的事物也有积极的感觉。例如，当你拥有某样东西时，你会认为它比未拥有时更有价值。这就是所谓的“禀赋效应”。“这种影响在西方文化中比在东亚文化中更为强烈。所以我们一直在寻找其他的方式来看看这种乐观看待自我的动机是否是由文化经历形成的。

我们也开始研究文化是如何影响睡眠的。尽管我们对这一课题的研究仍处于探索阶段，但值得注意的是，东亚人每晚的平均睡眠时间比北美人少一个半小时。这并不是因为这样的睡眠更有效，也不是因为他们在压缩自己的时间里更多的价值。其他的研究发现，即使是东亚的婴儿，睡眠时间也比欧洲婴儿少一个小时。所以我们想弄清楚文化是如何影响睡眠的。

我们的实验不是在睡眠实验室里进行的。而是，我们给人们运动检测手表，只要不是洗澡或游泳的时候就戴着，戴一星期。在睡眠研究中，这些手表被用来测量人们的睡眠时间、睡眠效率以及他们是否在夜间醒来。理想情况下，我希望在一个受控制的实验室环境中做这个试验。那样研究就会指出我们的方向。但我们通常从更经济的方法开始，如果一切看起来都很有希望的话，那么建立一个睡眠实验室并以这种方式研究跨文化的睡眠现象是合理的。

为什么我们要学习睡眠？睡眠的确是一个尚未被跨文化探索的话题。我之所以被它吸引，是因为文化不仅塑造了我们的思维方式；它也塑造了我们的身体运作方式，睡眠就在这些方式的交叉点。
