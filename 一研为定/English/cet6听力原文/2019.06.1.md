W: I am a colleague of Brenda. I was a little surprised to be invited, to be honest. We’ve only been working together the last six months, but we quickly became good friends. [1] We just wrapped up a project with a difficult client last week. I bet Brenda is glad it’s done with, and she can focus on the wedding preparations.

M: Oh, yes. So you’re Kathy from the office. Actually I’ve heard a lot about you and that project. The client sounded like a real nightmare.

W: Oh, he was. I mean we deal with all kinds of people on a regular basis. It’s part of the job, but he was especially particular. Enough about that, what line of work are you in？

M: Well, right out of college I worked in advertising for a while. Recently though I turned my photography hobby into a small business. [2] I’ll actually be taking photos during the big event as a wedding gift.

W: That sounds wonderful and very thoughtful of you. I bake just as a hobby. But Brenda has asked me to do the cake for the wed-ding. [3] I was a bit nervous saying yes, because I’m far from a professional.

M: Did you bake the cookies here at the party tonight?

W: Yes, I got the idea from a magazine.

M: They’re delicious. You’ve got nothing to worry about. You’re a natural.

W: You really think so？

M: If you hadn’t told me that, I would have guessed they were baked by the restaurant. [4] You know, with your event planning and experience. you could very well open your own shop.

女：听起来不错, 你想得真周到。我烤面包只是作为一种爱好。但是布伦达让我为她的婚礼做蛋糕。她的话让我有点紧张，因为毕竟我离专业的面包师还差的有些远。

男：今晚聚会上的这些饼干是你烤出来的吗？

女：是的，我从一本杂志上得到了这样一个主意。

男：饼干很美味。你没什么好担心的。你已经很棒了。

女：你真的这么认为吗？

M: You’re heading for a completely different world, now that you' re about to graduate from high school.

W: I know it’s the end of high school, but many of my classmates are going on to the same university, and we are still required to study hard. So what's the difference?

M: Many aspects are different here at university.[5] The most important one is that you have to take more individual responsibility for your actions. It’s up to your own self-discipline-how much effort you put into study. Living in college dormitories, there are no parents to tell you to study harder or stop wasting time. Lectures have hundreds of students and they' re not going to follow you up or question you if you miss their lectures.

W: Nobody cares, you mean?

M: It’s not that nobody’s concerned about you. [6] It’s just that suddenly at university you are expected to behave like an adult.That means concentrating on the direction of your life in general and your own academic performance specifically.

W: For example?

M: Well, like you need to manage your daily, weekly and monthly schedules, so that you’ll study regularly. Be sure to attend all classes and leave enough time to finish assignments and prepare well for examinations.

W: Okay. And what else is different?

M: Well, in college there are lots of distractions, and you need to control yourself. [7] You will make interesting friends, but you need only keep the friends who respect your students’ commitments. [8] Also, there are a lot of wonderful clubs but you shouldn’t allocate too much time to club activities unless they’re directly related to your study. It’s also your choice if you want to go out at night but you would be foolish to let that affect your class performance during the day.

W: Well, I’m determined to do well at university and I guess I’m going to have to grow up fast.



**Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.**

5. What does the man say about college students as compared with high scholars？

6. What are college students expect to do according to the man？

7. What kind of friends does the man suggest the woman make as a college student？

8. What kind of club activities should college students engage in according to the man？





男：你很快就要去到一个完全不同的世界了，因为现在你马上就要高中毕业了。

女：我知道高中就要结束了，但是我的很多同学都在上同一所大学，我们仍然需要努力学习。所以究竟有什么不同呢？

男：大学在很多方面都不一样。最重要的是，你必须为自己的行为承担更多的个人责任。这取决于你自己是否自律——你在学习上投入了多少努力。当你自己住在大学宿舍里，你的父母将不会再告诉你要更加努力学习，或者告诉你要停止浪费时间。课堂上有数百名学生，如果你错过了老师们的课，他们不会继续为你补课弥补进度，也不会问你问题。

女：你是说没人在乎？

男：并不是没有人关心你。只是在大学里，大家都会突然以成年人的要求来约束你。这意味着，从大体上来说，你自己要更加关注你的人生方向，尤其是你自己的学业成绩，更加需要你自己来管理。

女：例如？

男：嗯，你需要管理好你的每日、每周和每月的学习计划表，这样你才能有规律地学习。记得务必参加所有的课程，留出足够的时间完成老师布置的作业，并且要为考试做好充足的准备。

女：好的。还有什么不同呢？

男：嗯，大学里有很多让人分心的事情，这时候，你就需要学会控制你自己。你会交到很多有趣的朋友，但你只需要交那些尊重你学生时代承诺的朋友。除此之外，大学也有很多很棒的学生社团俱乐部，但你不应该分配太多的时间到社团俱乐部的活动上，除非这些活动与你的学习直接相关。如果你想在晚上出去，这也是你的选择，但如果让晚上外出影响你白天的课堂表现，那就太愚蠢了。

女：嗯，我决心在大学里取得好成绩，我想我必须快点长大。



5. 比起高中生，男士对大学生的看法是什么？

A）他们需要花更多时间学习。	B）他们要参加社团活动。

C）他们要对学术有特殊的限制。	D）他们要对自己的行为负责。

### Passage 1

**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**



9. A) They are prepared to work harder than anyone else.

B) They break away from traditional ways of thinking.

C) They bring their potential into full play.

D) They are good at refining old formulas.



10. A) They made explosive news in the sports world.

B) They promoted the scientific use of skiing poles.

C) They resulted in a brand-new style of skiing technique.

D) They contributed to the popularity of skiing worldwide.



11. A) He won three gold medals in one Winter Olympics.

B) He broke three world skiing records in three years.

C) He competed in all major skiing events in the world.

D) He was recognized as a genius in the world of sports.





[9] Most successful people are unorthodox persons whose minds wander outside traditional ways of thinking. Instead of trying to refine old formulas, they invent new ones. When Jean-Claude Killy made the French national ski team in the early 1960s, he was prepared to work harder than anyone else to be the best. At the crack of dawn, he would run up the slopes with his skis on, an unbelievably backbreaking activity. In the evening, he would do weightlifting and running. But the other team members were working as hard and long as he was. He realized instinctively that simply training harder would never be enough. Killy then began challenging the basic theories of racing technique.

Each week he would try something different to see if he could find a better, faster way down the mountain. [10] His experiments resulted in a new style that was almost exactly opposite the exact technique of the time. It involved skiing with his legs apart for better balance and sitting back on the skis when he came to a turn. He also used ski poles in an unorthodox way to propel himself as he skied. The explosive new style helped cut Killy’s racing time dramatically. In 1966 and 1967, he captured virtually every major skiing trophy. [11] The next year, he won three gold medals in the Winter Olympics, a record in ski racing that has never been topped. Killy learned an important secret shared by many creative people: innovations don’t require genius, just a willingness to question the way things have always been done.



**Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

9. What does the speaker say about most successful people？

10. What does the speaker say about Killy’s experiments？

11. What is said to be Killy’s biggest honor in his skiing career？





大多数成功人士都是非正统的人，他们的思想游离于传统思维方式之外。他们没有试图改进旧的公式，而是发明了新的公式。20世纪60年代初，让·克劳德·基利进入法国国家滑雪队时，他准备比任何人都更加努力，成为最好的滑雪队队员。破晓时分，他就会穿着滑雪板跑上斜坡，这是一项令人难以置信的累人活动。晚上，他会做举重和跑步。但是其他队员和他一样努力，训练时间也一样长。他本能地意识到仅仅加大训练量是远远不够的。然后基利开始挑战基本的滑雪竞技理论，寻找新的滑雪方法。

每星期他都会尝试不同的方法，看看是否能找到更好更快的下山方法。他的实验产生了一种与当时的技术几乎完全相反的新风格。这包括两腿分开滑雪以保持更好的平衡，以及在转弯时坐在滑雪板上。他还以一种非传统的方式使用滑雪杖来推动自己滑雪。这种爆炸性的新风格大大缩短了基利的比赛时间。在1966年和1967年，他几乎赢得了所有主要的滑雪奖杯。下一年，他在冬季奥运会上获得了三枚金牌，创下了滑雪比赛的最高纪录。基利学到了一个许多有创造力的人都知道的重要秘密：创新不需要天才，只要愿意质疑做事的方式就行。



**9. 讲话者如何评价大多数成功人士？**

A）他们比别人更加努力。

B）他们不拘泥于传统思维方式。

C）他们充分发挥自己的潜能。

D）他们善于改变传统。



**10. 讲话者如何评价基利的实验？**

A）在体育界造成了爆炸性的影响。

B）使人们能够更加科学的使用滑雪杖。

C）实验产生了一种新的滑雪风格。

D）实验使滑雪在全世界范围内更受欢迎。



**11. 基利滑雪生涯的最高荣誉是什么？**

A）他在一场冬奥会中赢得三块金牌。

B）他在三年之内打破三项滑雪记录。

C）他参加了世界范围内所有主要的滑雪比赛。

D）他是公认的体育界天才。

Scientific experiments have demonstrated incredible ways to kill a guinea pig, a small furry animal. Emotional upsets generate powerful and deadly toxic substances. [12] Blood samples taken from persons experiencing intense fear or anger when injected into guinea pigs have killed them in less than two minutes.Imagine what these poisonous substances can do to your own body.

[13] Every thought that you have affects your body chemistry within a split second. Remember how you feel when you’re speeding down the highway. And a big truck suddenly breaks 20 meters in front of you. A shockwave shoot through your whole system. Your mind produces instant reactions in your body.

The toxic substances that fear, anger, frustration and stress produce not only kill guinea pigs but kill us off in a similar manner. [14] It is impossible to be fearful anxious irritated and healthy at the same time. It is not just difficult it is impossible. Simply put your body’s health is a reflection of your mental health. Sickness will often then be a result of unresolved inner conflicts which in time show up in the body.

It is also fascinating how our subconscious mind shapes our health. Do you recall falling sick on a day when you didn’t want to go to school. Headaches brought on by fear? [15] The mind-body connection is such that if, for example, we want to avoid something, very often our subconscious mind will arrange it. Once we recognize that these things happen to us, we are halfway to doing something about them.



**Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.**

12. What happens to guinea pigs when blood samples of angry people are injected into them？

13. What does the speaker say about every thought you have？

14. What does the speaker say is impossible？

15. What does the passage say about our mind and body？







科学实验已经使用了令人难以置信的方法来杀死豚鼠，一种毛茸茸的小动物。情绪上的不安会产生强大而致命的有毒物质。从经历强烈恐惧或愤怒的人身上提取的血液样本被注射到豚鼠体内，不到两分钟就杀死了它们。想象一下这些有毒物质会对你的身体造成什么影响。

你的每一个想法都会在一瞬间影响你身体的化学反应。记住你在高速公路上超速行驶时的感受。一辆大卡车突然在你前面20米处抛锚。冲击波穿过你的整个身体。你的大脑会在你的身体里产生即时的反应。

害怕，愤怒，沮丧和压力产生的有毒物质不仅会杀死豚鼠，还能够以类似的方式杀死我们。恐惧、焦虑、愤怒和健康是不可能同时并在的。这不仅困难，甚至是不可能的。简单地说，你身体的健康是你心理健康的反映。疾病往往是未解决的内在冲突的结果，这些冲突最终会在身体机能中显现出来。

我们的潜意识是如何塑造健康的这一问题，这也令人着迷。你还记得有一天你不想上学时生病的情景吗？或者你还记得由恐惧引起的头痛？身体机能和人的意识的确存在某种联系，例如，如果我们想要避免某件事，我们的潜意识通常就会这么做。一旦我们意识到某些事情正发生在我们身上，我们其实已经在做这些事情了。



12. 从经历强烈恐惧或愤怒的人身上提取的血液样本被注射到豚鼠体内时，发生了什么？

A）它们变得兴奋。

B）它们几乎瞬间就死亡。

C）它们变得焦虑。

D）它们失去意识。



13. 讲话者如何评价人的每个想法？

A）它对造就人的思维方式有影响。

B）它可以给人造成长久的印象。

C）它时时刻刻都存在于你周围

D）它会在一瞬间影响人身体的化学反应。



14. 讲话者认为什么是不可能的？

A）在心情很低沉的同时保持健康。

B）远离沮丧与失败。

C）虽然不健康但仍能保持好心情。

D）在感到烦恼的同时取得成功。



15. 演讲者如何评价人思想和身体机能之间的关系？

A）它们的运作方式相似。

B）它们紧密相连。

C）它们太过复杂难以理解。

D）它们互为补充。

### Recording 1

**Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

16. A) They differ in their appreciation of music.

B) They finger the piano keys in different ways.

C) They choose different pieces of music to play.

D) They focus their attention on different things.



17. A) They manage to cooperate well with their teammates.

B) They use effective tactics to defeat their competitors.

C) They attach great importance to high performance.

D) They try hard to meet the spectators’ expectations.



18. A) It gives rise to controversy among experts.

B) It supports a piece of conventional wisdom.

C) It adopts a conventional approach to research.

D) It marks a breakthrough in behavioral science.





Teachers and students alike have experienced the curious paradox that beginners, as a rule, tend to think too little about what they are doing because they think too much about what they are doing. Take for example people who are learning to play basketball or the piano. [16] They have to give so much thought and attention to the low-level mechanics of handling the ball or fingering the keys or reading the music, that they are unable to give any thought to the thing that matters—the game, or the music, respectively. With experts it's just the other way around. They are open to the tactical possibilities and the musical challenges precisely because they are freed, through skill from the need to pay attention to the low-level details of how to play. Indeed, when the expert pays attention to the mechanics, this is liable to disrupt performance.

This has led some to say that the expert operates in a zone “beyond thought”, in a state of flow. But this is misleading. Expert performance is not beyond thought. [17] Smart basketball players or skilled musicians need to pay close attention to the demands of high performance, to the challenges to be overcome. What they don’t need to do—what would be a distraction—is to have to think about where their fingers are, or how to control the ball while running. It’s not mechanics, but the play itself, that absorbs the experts’ intelligence. A nice video published online last month sheds light on expertise and the conscious mind. The video reports a new study using an eye-tracking device. It turns out that the less-skilled pianist spends more time looking at her fingers than does the expert who, in contrast, is more likely to be looking at the sheet music, or looking ahead at keys he’s not yet playing. In general, the expert’s gaze was calmer and more stable.

 [18] This is not a surprising finding. It supports what we might almost think of as conventional wisdom. But it’s remarkable for all that, nonetheless. The eye tracker gives expert and learning performers a glimpse into what they do without thinking about it. The topic of the nature of skill—and the differences between beginners and experts—has been one of considerable discussion in cognitive science and philosophy.



**Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard**

16. What does the speaker say about beginners and expert pianists？

17. What do smart basketball players do according to the speaker？

18. What do we learn about the new study published in an online video？







老师和学生都经历过一个奇怪的悖论：初学者通常对自己正在做的事情想得太少，因为他们考虑得太多。例如正在学习打篮球或弹钢琴的人。他们不得不花太多的心思和精力在处理球、拨弄琴键或阅读音乐的低级技巧上，以至于他们无法去想那些重要的事情——比赛或音乐本身。对于专家来说，恰恰相反。他们对技术上的可能性和音乐上的挑战持开放态度，正是因为他们通过技巧将注意力从如何演奏的低级细节中解放出来。事实上，当专家关注细枝末节时，他们的表现可能会受到影响。

这导致一些人说，专家是在“超乎想象”的状态下工作的，他们的想法处于流动状态。但这是一种误导。专家的表现并不是无法想象的。聪明的篮球运动员或熟练的音乐家需要密切关注对高水平表现的要求，关注要克服的挑战。他们不需要做的——这可能会分散注意力——是考虑他们的手指在哪里，或者在跑步时如何控制球。吸收专业智慧的不是如何表现，而是表现本身怎样。上个月网上发布的一段不错的视频揭示了专业知识和有意识的思维之间的关系。该视频报道了一项使用眼球追踪设备的新研究。事实证明，技能较差的钢琴家花在看手指上的时间比专家多。相比之下，专家更有可能在看乐谱，或者在看他尚未弹奏的琴键。总的来说，专家的目光更冷静、更稳定。

这一发现并不令人惊讶。它支撑了我们几乎可以认为是传统智慧的观点。尽管如此，这一切仍然是值得注意的。眼动仪可以让专业人士和学习能力强的人不假思索地了解自己在做什么。技能的本质——以及初学者和专家之间的差异——一直是认知科学和哲学领域的重要讨论话题之一。



16. 讲话者如何评价钢琴初学者与钢琴家？

A）他们对音乐的鉴赏水平不同。

18. 关于网上发布的视频所涉及的研究，我们了解到什么？

A）它导致专家之间产生意见的分歧。

B）它验证了传统智慧的正确性。

### Recording 2



**Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.**



19. A) The great variety of slimming products.

B) The increasing range of fancy products.

C) People’s craze for good health.

D) People’s envy of slim models.



20. A) They look charming.

B) They look unhealthy.

C) They appear vigorous.

D) They appear strange.



21. A) Peer pressure.

B) Media influence.

C) Culture and upbringing.

D) Wealth and social status.





Every summer when I top up my selection of summer outfits from the department stores, my eyes would nearly pop out of my head. [19] I’m overwhelmed with the wide range of different slimming products each year. And more shockingly, these products are often advocated by very slim models. Having lived in Asia for almost ten years now, I’ve seen various dieting tips come and go. I remember in Japan people heading directly to the food section in the supermarket when the banana diet was at its peak. Then, there was the black tea and oolong tea diet followed by the soybean diet and the tomato juice diet. The list goes on and on.



Apart from what people eat, I’ve also seen many interesting slimming products. [20] In Hong Kong, I’ve seen girls wrapping their whole body or both legs up with a special type of slimming tape which is supposed to help make them thinner. But it just reminded me of the roasted ham my mother usually puts on the dinner table of Christmas. Then there were the face slimming rollers that were said to improve your blood circulation and make your face smaller. Personally, I do not believe in any of these slimming gadgets. And I think I have a very different perspective when it comes to the definition of what is beautiful. Asian women prefer to avoid the sun because being pale or white is considered beautiful, whereas a tanned complexion is considered much more beautiful and sexy in the west. [21] It is most certainly shaped by a person's culture as well as how they were raised in their childhood.As each summer season approaches, there's no escape from it.

But it's not only women who are affected by this pressure to look good. Men aspire to be able to show off their six packs or their V-shape backs and there's a growing market of slimming pills aimed at men too. I think no matter what diets we follow or what slimming products we obsess ourselves with, at the end of the day there's no magic trick to shape up for the summer. Eat in a balanced way and incorporate the right level of physical activity. For me, this still seems to be the best plan.



**Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.**

19. What overwhelms the speaker when she buys her summer outfits each year？

20. What does the speaker think of girls wrapping their legs up with slimming tape？

21. What does the speaker think affects people's interpretation of beauty？







每年夏天，当我在百货公司选购夏装时，我的眼睛几乎要挑花了。每年我都被各种各样的减肥产品所淹没。更令人震惊的是，这些产品通常由非常苗条的模特代言。在亚洲生活了近10年，我看到各种各样的节食秘诀来来去去。我记得在日本，当香蕉饮食最盛行的时候，人们会直奔超市的食品区购买香蕉。其次是红茶和乌龙茶减肥法，再然后是大豆和番茄汁减肥法。这样的例子不胜枚举。

除了食品，我还看到了许多有趣的减肥产品。在香港，我曾见过一些女孩用一种特殊的减肥胶带包裹全身或双腿，据说这种胶带能让她们更瘦。但这让我想起了我妈妈在圣诞节的餐桌上放的烤火腿。还有一种减肥滚轮，据说可以改善血液循环，让你的脸变小。就我个人而言，我不相信这些减肥小工具。我认为我对于什么是美丽有着非常不同的观点。亚洲女性更喜欢避免晒太阳，因为人们认为白皮肤是美丽的，而在西方，人们通常认为晒黑的皮肤更美丽和性感。美的定义是由一个人的文化传统以及他们童年时的成长方式所塑造的。随着每个夏季的临近，它无处可逃。

但不仅仅是女性会受到这种压力的影响。男性也渴望展示自己的六块腹肌或V型后背，针对男性的减肥药市场也在不断扩大。我认为，不管我们遵循什么样的饮食习惯，也不管我们沉迷于什么样的减肥产品，没有什么神奇的方法可以让我们在夏天保持身材。饮食要平衡并进行适当的体育锻炼。对我来说，这似乎仍然是最好的计划。



19. 每年当演讲者买夏装时，是什么淹没了她？

A）各种各样的减肥产品。

B）越来越多的高档产品。

A）她们看起来很迷人。

B）她们看起来不健康。

C）她们看起来充满活力。

D）她们看起来很奇怪。

A）来自同伴的压力。

B）媒体的影响。

### Recording 3

**Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording you have just heard.**



22. A) The growing interest in skin studies.

B) The relation between hair and skin.

C) The need of skin protection.

D) The color of human skin.



23. A) The necessity to save energy.

B) The need to breathe with ease.

C) Adaptation to the hot environment.

D) Dramatic climate changes on earth.



24. A) Leaves and grass.

B) Their skin coloring.

C) Man-made shelter.

D) Hair on their skin.



25. A) Their genetic makeup began to change.

B) Their pace of evolution began to quicken.

C) Their communities began to grow steadily.

D) Their children began to mix with each other.







Skin may seem like a superficial human attribute, but it is the first thing we notice about anyone we meet. As a zoologist focusing on the studies of apes and monkeys, I’ve been studying why humans evolved to become the naked ape, and why skin comes in so many different shades around the world.

[22] We can make a very good estimate from the fossil record that humans probably evolved naked skin around a million and a half years ago. And meanwhile, they mostly lost their coat of fur. Today, we have a few patches of hair remaining on various parts of our bodies. But compared with apes and monkeys, we have very little. Basically, we turned our skin darker to serve as a natural sun-protector in the place of the hair we lost. [23] We think we lost this hair because of the need to keep ourselves cool, when we were moving around vigorously in a hot environment. We can't really lose heat by breathing quickly and loudly like dogs. We have to do it by sweating. So we evolved the ability to sweat plentifully, and lost most of our fur.

 [24] Most animals protect themselves from the sun with fur. What we did in our ancestry was to produce more permanent natural coloring in our skin cells. This was really an important revolution in human history, because it allowed us to continue to evolve in equatorial environments. It really made it possible for us to continue along the path toward modern humans in Africa.

For most of the human history, we all had dark skin. What we see today is the product of evolutionary events, resulting from the dispersal of a few human populations out of Africa around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. Our species originated around 200,000 years ago, and underwent tremendous diversification, culturally, technologically, linguistically, artistically, for 130,000 years. After that, a few small populations left Africa to populate the rest of the world. These early ancestors of modern Eurasians disperse into parts of the world that had more seasonal sunshine and much lower levels of sun radiation. [25] It’s in these populations that we begin to see real changes in the genetic makeup of natural coloring.

Today, skin color is evolving via new mixtures of people coming together and having children with new mixtures of skin color genes. We can see this in almost every large city worldwide. Not only the coloring genes, but lots of other genes are getting mixed up, too.

皮肤可能看起来是一种表层的人类属性，但它却是我们见到的任何人的第一印象。作为一名专注于猿类和猴子研究的动物学家，我一直在研究为什么人类进化成裸猿，以及为什么世界各地人们的皮肤可以有这么多不同的色调。

我们可以从化石记录中大致估测出，人类大概在150万年前进化出了裸露的皮肤。与此同时，他们几乎失去了皮毛。今天，我们身体的各个部位还残留着几块毛发。但是与猿类和猴子相比，我们的毛发非常少。基本上，我们把皮肤晒黑，皮肤就作为一种天然的防晒产品来代替我们失去的毛发。我们认为头发脱落是因为当我们在炎热的环境中精力充沛地走动时，人类需要保持凉爽。我们不能像狗一样通过快速而大声的呼吸来散热。我们必须通过流汗来散热。所以我们进化出了大量出汗的能力，并且失去了大部分的皮毛。

大多数动物用毛皮保护自己不受日晒。我们祖先所做的，则是在我们的皮肤细胞中产生更持久的天然色素。这在人类历史上确实是一场重要的革命，因为它使我们能够在赤道环境中继续进化。它真正使我们有可能继续沿着非洲的现代人类之路前进。

在人类历史的大部分时间里，我们都是黑皮肤。我们今天看到的皮肤，则是进化的产物，大约6万到7万年前，一些人口从非洲离开。我们的物种起源于20万年前，经历了13万年的文化、技术、语言和艺术上的巨大变化。在那之后，少数人离开非洲，移居世界其他地方。这些现代欧亚混血儿的早期祖先分散到世界各地，那里有更多的季节性日照和更低的太阳辐射水平。正是在这些种群中，天然色素基因构成的真正变化开始慢慢产生。

如今，肤色是通过新的人群混合方式而进化的，不同肤色的人聚集在一起，他们的孩子也有了新的混合肤色基因。我们可以在世界上几乎每个大城市看到这一点。不仅是肤色基因，还有很多其他基因也混在了一起。
